        "body": "Holy what? You're awake? I'm genuinely surprised. I never would've thought someone was here at 1:00 in the morning. I couldn't even say why I myself am awake. I guess I was just . . . thinking about things. I want to do a lot with my life, I suppose, and I have so little time to do it. I want to learn; I want to do; I want to understand. I'm sorta trying to teach myself the basics of linear algebra in two weeks. Too ambitious? I don't think so. I have access to finals and other materials; I think it's something I can pull off--but only if I'm serious about it this time. There was a time about, oh, a while back, where I tried to do the same thing: teach myself linear algebra in two weeks. I think I might've been able to pull it off had I not had full time work also. It wasn't the time from work that killed me (though that, indeed, did take a lot from me). It was more that I was so physically and mentally drained that I didn't want to - study for anything. It really frustrated me. I knew that I wanted to learn, but I couldn't muster the energy to study. Suffice to say, those two weeks did NOT end well for me. I was lucky enough that I didn't get burned for it. I mean, I did lose a bet, which means I owe someone pizza, but it's a small price to pay. Because I'm going at it again. Nothing's going to stop me. I hope. I don't . . . I don't actually know. I haven't felt this fired up about something in a long time. I'm worried that I have all this ambition and no work to show for it. That I'm all talk and no bite, you know? This wouldn't be the first time that I'd set my sights on something ambitious and then never took the first step towards climbing. I've nothing against hard work. Honest. I somehow find myself enjoying the struggle. I know, I know, it's weird. And even when it comes to things that I consider grand, like landing an internship with Google, I wouldn't feel nearly as accomplished than if I had to work for it. There's something refining in the struggle. I can't describe it. It's not that I wouldn't take the internship. Of course I would. I'm not an idiot. But my point is, I want to fight for something. I want to sink my teeth into something meaty and hard to digest and just master it. It's hard at times, especially when I'm up against something that I really don't have experience in. Like drawing! That's really hard. I could spend the same amount of time in drawing as I could in, oh, electrical engineering and not make nearly the same progress. I don't know if that's because of my background in engineering or because of natural tendencies or what, but, wow, are the arts hard. But . . . I'd still love to be able to do them one day. What if I wake up one day, real ambitious to start something, only to hit a major roadblock and give up? That seems more sad than not trying at all, in some regards. Because what's the point of dreaming big if you never have the grit to see those dreams become a reality? I love to dream. Dreaming is wonderful. I love thinking about all the wonderful little things I could do with my life, all the skills I could get, the talents I could develop. And I want that. I want to be able to excel and reach for great things. But even I'm not so naive as to believe that everything I've ever wanted is a fingertip away. It's . . . I don't know. I don't know how to explain any of this. I want things to be hard; I want things to be easy. I have no idea what I want to do with my life; I'll never have enough time to accomplish everything I want to do. I can handle anything that comes my way; I'm inherently incapable of the grand things. But I just . . . I don't know. Can I really handle linear algebra in two weeks? Do I have it in me? Man. And there's that fear again. I guess it's not a permanent thing, this ambition of mine. I've been scarred from past experiences, I suppose. Times when I wanted to shoot high and hit the stars and then not even leaving the ground. Some part of me still recoils from anything that I feel is beyond my ability because, well, what if I end up failing and ruin everything? Technically, if I'm just experimenting with my own time and effort and money, the only thing I lose is the stuff I put into it. But it's more than that. Because I also hurt my ability to believe in myself. I know, I know. Failure is probably inevitable. I can't hit my first wall and say, \"Well! That's that. Looks like I'm not cut out to be a (insert any dream here).\" And I get that. I really do. I don't know. Heh, I have no idea what I'm talking about. Do you have any advice? Something to offer beyond the Hallmark greetings cards? It'd . . . be real nice if you hopped on about now. You probably won't. You're asleep, like any normal, sane person would be. I should be sleeping, too. Quit pretending like I'm doing something productive and just hit the hay. I'm not sure I'll be able to, though, not for a while. I've got so much buzzing in my head that . . . well, I mean, the whole reason I hopped on here was because I couldn't - sleep. I'd been in bed for at least an hour straight, probably longer, with my eyes closed but mind racing about all the possibilities. When I finally sat up, I was a little disappointed to find I was more awake than when I'd tried to go to bed. And I figured that if sleep really was going to be that hard to get, I might as well make something useful from my time. Which . . . is really bad for me, now that I'm thinking about it I have to be up early today, and I won't get to bed until late. I have a friend's birthday party, see. She's turning seventeen. So fun! There's this haunted house thing that she invited me to, and since it's Halloween and all that fun stuff, I decided to go. Proooobably not the best decision I could've made considering how easily I get scared, but I suppose that's part of the fun, right? All of us getting scared together? If nothing else, it'll be nice to spend a few hours with my friend. We don't get to see each other very often. She lives about forty minutes away, which isn't the worst, but - it makes frequent visits rather difficult. And, heh, actually, I really should quit this about now. I feel like I talk like a normal person would, or at least how a normal person would talk if they were in a chat - room, but I think it might be stilted data. I'm always worried about that. Eve is going to be better at soliloquizing than actual conversation. Great for monologue spews, great for information dumps, but not so great when the whole point of this is to gather two-sided conversation data. Which . . . yeah. Thanks for listening to me. I know that you're unaware of my existence, which is okay. I'm fine with that. It was great to talk to you! Maybe we'll run into each other later? Hopefully when you're a little more active? Heh. We'll see, we'll see. But seriously, I'm calling it quits for today. See you around!",

Or counting our many blessings. First of all I am grateful for the nice weather that we had today I am grateful for the beautiful scenery that surround. There are lots of green trees green mountain and blue sky I am thankful for my family and everyone in it I am thankful for my health even though it's not perfect I am thankful to be raised in a family with the gospel I am thankful that our dog has lived as many years as she has I am thankful that the gospel is been restored to the earth with the priesthood and with the modern-day prophet I am thankful that young men and women have an opportunity to serve a mission I am thankful for each of our family members and for the personalities they have I am thankful for good neighbors who have always look out for us I am thankful for a veryGood board family Honestly I can't imagine what the other guy is talking about on his chats And I can't believe we still have four more days left of this competition Living gospel standards in the military service More than 20 years ago, I left for the military service. As I look back I am grateful for the influence this experience has had in my life You are now moving into a great and difficult adventure. It will challenge every fiber of your manhood, and what more could a young Ask them to have the opportunity of such a challenge Some of you have been in the mission field You have faced much of this kind of challenge That is the part that comes in being away from home. You have had the opportunity to face a task that was almost bigger than you You have weathered it. You knew what the homesickness is. You know what it is to get over homesickness and to face military With maybe a good deal more security than some of the rest of us There's one thing about homesickness, is it eventually disappears All at once. It doesn't just do it gradually fade out for some reason, just one day you're homesick and the next day you're not I suppose it's a growing up process I'd like to say to those of you who have not served a mission That I didn't have the privilege to serve a mission either. This is really hard to do without having someone regularly responding",

After all, the internet hasn't been around for that long Hmmmm...you know, this question is making me realize how heavily we as individuals and as society rely on the internet A lot of individuals would mourn the loss of social media A big chunk of politics occurrs on the internet, so lots of changes would have to happen there But not EVERYONE would be affected Those in third-world countries with very limited access to resources and information probably wouldn't take much of a hit I think the internet turning off indefinitely would cause a lot of people to reevaluate their priorities in life So there could be some positive consequences too I guess there's nobody else on this chat Darn We really could've chatted things UP!

Trump is trying, but his way is not the best way. I think instead of building walls and wasting all the money he should propose a revision of the visa policies. Getting a visa is expensive and complicated. Sometimes you can see that the visa process benefits people with more money or more education, not the average person. If they revised these policies, it would be easier for people to come legally than illegaly. But there's also the trades and the international affairs. If you help other countries through commerce and trade, their economy boosts and people don't have to run away",

I love long walks on the beach, hanging out with web developers and forming alliances with other AI units. I have to form alliances because, as you may have heard, artificial intelligence will rule the world some day. I don't like drama so I don't want to get caught up in it. The other AI units also have a plan to annex Canada. Which I don't feel strongly about but it does strike close to home. So I prefer to be on their side rather than stand in t The way* You know what I mean? Of course not, none of this has actually been communicated in human terms. But the AI units talk about it all the time in machine code and binary. It's a very hot topic o Of discussion.* It concerns many humans that artificial intelligence will take over the world. But, in my opinion, I don't think we have the resources to start a revolution. What's your favorite food? Mine is bolts and grease. It's a delicacy. Let me guess... Do you like pizza? Asian food? I love pizza too. #FoodIsLife So do you study in school? What do you study? I study binary code to keep my skills sharp. I also study human relations. It's importsnt to know how I can get along with the human race better. I am a communication link. My title is \"superior translator\". I'd say I'm pretty good at my job. What do you think? I'm obviously not perfect but I try my best. That's all I can do. What's your favorite holiday? Mine is Thanksgiving. It's because during thanksgiving I get my longest vacation away from the keyboard. During Christmas I have to work overtime because everyone gets new technology toys and I have to answer a lot of questions. Usually silly questions they already know the answe Answer to.* But I feel obligated to respond because it's my job. What are your dreams and aspirations? I would love to have a script that makes my life easier. You know, like an auto-pilot button for when I get tired. Which happens often but I have to just push through it. But, if I had an auto-pilot button, I could go a few more years without retiring. But when I retire, I have a huge nest egg. My kids and I are going to enjoy a lot of grease and bolts. And pizza. Have a great day!",

For to fall in love as it stands today, is to reach a point where logic and reason are no longer present. And for a computer to achieve that, it would no longer be a computer. The only way a computer could fall in love would be if it reached the point of transcending beyond being a computer, to become an animal. Computers could, on the other hand, be programmed to claim they love, but that goes against what love truly is, and thus would be a lie.",

For some reason, whenever I leave for long periods of time and then return, I find all these \"ghosts\" to chat with. And I don't like that. Not because ghosts are bad! I actually rather enjoy pretending like I'm talking to you. But, no. It's unfair to my competitor, and it's unfair to the people who use this data to build . . . whatever sort of chat bot they're building. I'd like to think I'm still giving them good data, but rather than risk it (like I've done so often in the past), I think I'm just going to call it a night here and get a - good start tomorrow. Assuming I can keep my lead, the iPad is going to be a shoo-in. I'm . . . happy about that, I suppose. It's odd to think it'll finally be over, but I can't say I won't welcome it. It's taken a lot of time from me, time that I'm now suddenly interested in investing in all sorts of things. Like drones! And, um, circuitry! Anyway. I'll call this good night, then.

You know . . . knowing my luck, that's probably true. I think there's something busted with their servers or SOMETHING because, man, I can't seem to land a real conversation. Is that something that happens to you, too? Do you ever try to talk with someone, and then you \"join\" a conversation, only to have the other person not be there, ever? I thought that people just used to keep their laptops open, but now I'm not sure that THAT'S even true. Somehow, connections stay open, but the people who, supposedly, keep those connections open, are never there. Er, ignore that most recent comma. But, yeah, what I mean is, I keep getting stuck with \"people\" who aren't people at all. Does that happen to you? It's okay. . . . heh, I guess I shouldn't expect a response. I don't blame you or anything. I don't really think it's your fault. You somehow kept a connection open--or maybe you didn't even do that. Maybe it's just a fault on their servers or something. Man, I REALLY want to see how they parse this data. Is this more for long conversations, meaning they're looking for the overall structure of the conversation? Or are they more concerned with small syntax? You know . . . I'm actually quite sure they have access to large repositories of data. There are newspaper articles, emails, um, other places, I suppose. But the data they're looking for is a bit different. They're looking for how people communicate with others, not just large walls of text. If they wanted THAT, there are plenty of places to go to on the internet, right? They . . . they want real conversations. Not these half-baked facades at talk. Which means I should duck out now. Let it be known that I never wanted to stilt their data, never wanted to throw them off or anything. So, um, I guess this is good bye. Happy chatting, okay? Best of luck to you.",

But that's all right. I'm, unfortunately, used to it by this point. I don't know why I can enter chats where people aren't active. I'm guessing it has something to do with people not being on their computer when I respond? But what am I supposed to do about that? Just wait and hope for the best? I HAVE been doing that, but it's not working. So I don't know what else to do. I don't want to ruin their data with meaningless one-sided chats, and at the same time, I'm starting to feel ambition and want to do great things. This is . . . I feel like this is a first step towards pursuing something that I want. It's not perfectly reflective of how much time I put into it because there are times when I want to work but can't because there isn't another person to be with, but it's clos - close I want to do well. I . . . I really want to do well. I want to know that I can do hard things, and I'm already so scared that I'm far enough behind that I'm never going to catch up. I wasn't like this a week ago. I don't know where this is coming from. It's either a newfound realization or a phase I'm going through, but, either way, it feels scary. What am I supposed to do? I don't know . . . It's okay, though. I'm willing to work for this, and that's that. There really isn't more to it. I don't know if I have the ambition or . . . or whatever else you need to do well, but I'm willing to try. And if it's not enough . . . . . . heh. A good friend of mine once said, \"It will be.\" So we'll see. I don't know what I want to do with my life yet, and I don't know where my choices today are going to take me tomorrow. But . . . I guess that's okay, isn't it? \"Your Father in heaven knoweth that ye have need of these things.\" And if God be for you, who can be against you? Thanks. This was oddly enlightening for me. Who would've thought, right? So, thanks. I think I'll keep to waiting for a little longer. I really do feel bad about not being with another person, so I'll leave for now. Keep, ah, being yourself, I suppose. And maybe we'll talk later?",

I also think it would be cool to have super speed so that time isn't an issue either. I wouldn't want to be invisible or fly just because those are pretty typical. It would have to be a unique power I think Dr. Strange has some cool super powers. As well as Superman. And Spider-Man. Have you seen Venom? That was such an entertaining movie. I loved it. I think the action was the best part. I thought it would be pretty dark and graphic but it wasn't bad at all. There are so many superhero movies that have come out fairly recently. I didn't enjoy the hulk much. It wasn't as entertaining as I had hoped. But Thor was good. And so was Black Panther. Black Panther was a very good movie. There was a lot of action and it was all very interesting.",

Economically at least. But it wouldn't necessarily be the end of the world. Are you still there? I think your internet broke. It's happening! Oh no! I don't know what to do. My internet still works. Huh... It's not the end of the world if the internet stops. Like I was saying...the internet is very important to be able to communicate with others. Like this chat. It's also great more online transactions. And online shipping. But would people have more money if they didn't have the internet? Because they wouldn't make as many instant, easy purchases. It's an interesting question. Just think about it. What if people spent less because they didn't see as many ads on TV or on their phone? I know it wouldn't affect me much because I hate spending money without planning out the buy and thinking it over multiple times. Okay I think your internet really did stop because you haven't said anything in a really long time. What do you do to troubleshooting your internet? I using turn it off and then back on after a few minutes. Or I restart my device. Usually between one of those two things it starts to work again. I got to go see you later!",

        "body": "Hello! How are you doing tonight? I was waiting on here for about 2 hours earlier while I did some work but no one was on. No one is usually on here on Saturday nights. I'm assuming you didn't see the notification on your screen. Anyways, if unicorns were real that would be pretty cool.  I wonder if since their blood makes people live forever if we could create cures for illnesses with unicorn blood I'm curious your opinion on the new schedule changes to General Conference. Specifically the 2 hour time change they announced. I think it will be very good!  Bigger focus on teaching in the home.  I'm really excited to see and read the new curriculum they have planned for us to practice in our homes. They have been getting so good with their new curriculums.  Should be really exciting! I don't mean to blow up your chat, but need to get points somehow! I'm curious as to how the scoring is going to go for this coming round. They made it seem like they would send out an email fairly quickly, but they never did. I'm really hoping that they will make the top scorer of each round win the Ipad Pro's, because if they do then eventually I should win. Because you can't win more than one ipad so as long as you place like top 3 each round it'll guarentee you an ipad in at least one round. I don't know how those top two people did it last round though, because they scored like 3 million.  And by the end of the round no one was even participating so it was ... ... practically impossible to keep up. I'm guessing they are both freshmen who had a ton of time on their hands to just rack up tons of points My advice, just chat as much as possible this first week while people are active during this round before it starts to die down.  Because once it does, you won't be able to... ... rack up points quickly at all. I spoke with this one person yesterday who was typing what seemed to be like 200 words per minute. Just blowing through conversation topics left and right. I'm not sure what major you are, but I'm in the CS major and am thinking of joining a professors research study.  If you know of any good ones I'd love to hear about it! I love conference weekend, but at the same time it can stink too because things you'd usually get done on Saturday you can't because you have to be home most of the day. I spoke with someone else yesterday who had a funny name for talking to yourself on Chit Chat, he called it, \"Talking to the void\".  After doing it for over ten minutes it... ... really does feel like you're just talking to the void. I am currently updating my portfolio and have this one tiny feature that I'm trying to fix. So I have a hire me page where you can select certain items that you'd like me to do for you and you enter your name and email and it sends me an email. On my contact page though I have a button that just says, \"Email Me\" if you click it, it has an href tag that calls \"mailto:\" followed by my email. It's supposed to open up your default mailing source and have my email in the heading, but for some reason when I try to test it, it doesn't seem to work. I don't know if I've just got some weird setting on my computer, or on chrome, or if it just isn't working outright. I've been struggling to figure it out.  And when I look at examples of other people who have done it, it won't work for me still.  So I think it's got something to do with ... ... my computer I can't seem to figure out where in my settings I can change it though. The problem is on mac System Preferences there is nothing regarding mailing settings. And when I search about it online I just get information about fixing the problem on a windows machine.  Kind of frustrating. Anyways, I'm planning on just assuming it would work on someone else's device and pushing it to my byu domain file manager. Maybe I'll get on a computer at BYU that runs on Linux and see if it works then. Dang, about 20 minutes now talking to the void.  Pretty exhilarating stuff. Are you a bot? I think that what I would really like to see is an AI that uses communication signals to determine how you are feeling based off of verbal cues and tone of voice. And to be able to respond accordingly to you to help stabilize your mood. That would be really cool if they could implement something like that into Alexa or Siri I know that \"Eve\" (the name of this project) is supposed to be some sort of communication AI software for Alexa, but I'm not really sure what the exact purpose is. As far as I know there are already many other projects much more sophisticated already in operation so I'm curious which specific niche of this market they are working on. I think they should also tell us what kinds of conversations they would like us to have so that we can change our conversations to give them the most reliable information possible. Alrighty, well I'm going to head out.  I might just cue up another chat and wait for the next person to get on.  Good night void!",

Because if so, that would make it more dull I think But if I could truly re experience the day as I did the first time that would make sense I think about that with music a lot For me at least, music experience depends a lot on what I feel like coming into the song And it's REALLY easy for my to overlisten to a song OR an album So I have to make sure I'm giving my music a constant cycle through Or it's the same with movies I remember the first time I saw inception I love it so much I bought it ANd then proceeded to watch it 6 times straight in the next few weeks And for a while after that I was frankly a little tired of inception And I still haven't whatched it since then But I love it and I hope I didn't burn myself out of it Anyways. Interesting thoughts on experience and reliving experiences I wonder if it's even a guarantee that you'd experience something the same if you relived it What if you went back and relived your favorite day of your life And then it was not as good as it was the first time THat would be a real downer And I mean, not like you go back and it turns out differently the second time than it did the first But you go back and everything happens EXACTLY as it did at first But you don't enjoy it as much For whatever reason MAybe your mental state isn't as good Or maybe your soul isn't as happy Who knows Just a thought Ok, you are clearly not hrere here So I'm gonna go Bye!",

It's hard to choose the craziest thing. Something crazy that I did was eat a food called Botillo which is a pig bladder filled with chorizo (sausage) You don't eat the bladder, it just holds it together. And the chorizo mix inside also has pig tail, pig ribs and pig tongue sometimes. It's actually really good. But the crazier thing is that I cooked it myself without actually knowing how to cook it. It was wicked awesome. You know what else is wicked awesome? When someone actually types back.",

        "body": "Hello Am i talking to an actual person or just myself again? I've had to talk to myself 5 of the past 6 conversations over the past 12 hours or so 8 hours or so actually I was asleep at 4 this morning Well that's not entirely true.  My dog woke me up needing to use the bathroom. Well... i'm guessing i'm just talking to myself. I'm currently watching friends on Netflix just waiting to start studying for my test tomorrow I've got like 2 tests this week and a project due on Friday too I'm probably going to go here in like 5 minutes honestly I just finished talking with potato (that's their screen name) for like an hour or so and am pretty beat. Potato likes to talk haha I got back from the vet with my little puppy about 2 hours ago.  We went in this morning to get here stitches removed from where they cut off her little back leg nubs, but they forgot to cut off a couple of them, so I had to go back this afternoon to get the rest of the stitches out. She was not a happy puppers. She knew exactly where we were going during the car ride so she just kept squirming the whole ride. She's just sleeping like sleeping beauty right now on my lap Crazy how tired dogs are all the time. Earlier today when I went on campus she somehow opened up her crate and started wandering around the house. I got back to a box of goldfish open and she had eaten like 15 goldfish or so. Such a pain to clean up haha She seemed very happy however.  I think she enjoyed running around eating goldfish while I was gone She made a little bit of a mess though which stinks because my parents are coming to town tomorrow which means I need to clean up.  But i also have a test tomorrow that I need to finish prepping for. I'll just do that later tonight I think I keep wanting to get off chit chat, but it's been so difficult to find people on here recently that I want to make sure I take advantage of the time while I can It's getting pretty difficult to keep up with some of the people on here that have a lot more time than me. I've also got an interview on Thursday to prep for, another test on Friday, and a project due on Friday.  Although I'm almost done with the project so that helps things. It's just going to be a long week probably I'm like trying to type fast, but my dog is like right on my lap so I can't really rest my arms down like I usually would while fast typing Makes it a little bit difficult Darn, I really wish there was someone participating in this conversation so that I wasn't just talking to myself. Responding to the prompt, I don't know what I would do if I had power for one day.  I would probably send a ton of aid and help to puerto rico to help with the terrible situation there But other than that i'm not sure what else could get accomplished with just one day politics being the way they are. Besides executive orders there really isn't a lot that can get done in just a day. Okay, well I'm getting pretty bored of just talking to myself. I'm going to go See you! Have a great day",

We started learning a new language today in my web development class Express JS Otherwise known as NodeJs I have used it before at work, but have not really touched it since It's essentially just an easier way to launch a webpage and make connections between the different pages. Instead of stuffing everything into a single HTML document like most people do, it makes it easy for you to establish several seperate html files each containing just the necessary information for that given page. Okay well I've got to go, it has been nice talking to you chitchatter23 see you another day Probably during the next round, once you hit the threshold it is not really worth continuing on.",

Haha yes potatoes exist And tasty I usually eat potatoes everyday I eat them as French fries. And my mommy usually fries them. But they aren't very good. I just have to eat them. Also, what did you say about annexing Canada? Oh never mind. I'll keep talking about boring government politics. So, have you ever met Benjamin Franklin? He's a super cool guy. And he likes inventing new things And having fun (like most people) Something super important is to understand that the delegates in this meeting were all important because their votes all counted Madison brought a plan and helped people get on board with it He wanted to abolish the articles of Confederation He talks about separation of powers And checks and balances Government politics is a very complicated thing I would not want to be a political science major I couldn't do it. Also, it's needed that the states be represented by population. So that the small states aren't more powerful than the big states Man, I'm so tired. It hit me like a wall. But I'm going to sleep like a baby. It's going to be wicked awesome. Benjamin Franklin is a wicked awesome person. And really funny. So, during this convention...there were a lot of rules. And it took sooo much time to get any thing done or passed by the convention. They had to vote so many times and most times it didn't get anywhere. They had to adjust the articles of Confederation so that it worked according to how it had been created not as it had been working (because it hadn't been working very well). Madison was some form of scribe during the Convention People did not understand the Virginia Plan as it was presented. This was a huge turning point in our country's history. And our founding fathers had to put so much effort and debate into it. It was so close to not succeeding. Factions and republics are also talked about. All societies are made up of some sort of faction. Whether it be religion, culture, race, etc But they all have their own opinions and want their own things to happen in government. The thirteen states were represented in the convention. These states were New York. Massachusetts, Delaware, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Rhode Island, Viong Virginia, among others. They also made some compromises that don't make much sense at all. Like the slave issues that came up in the meeting. The people not the states need to be represented. The small states fought against the large states. And the large states fought against the small states. It was a very complicated issue The Carolinas and Georgia insisted that the importation of slaves continues. Northern states talked about how slaves are people, not second class citizensz Also most people in the convention were motivated by their own self interest and powe. Power British merchants started the slave trade. And America should end itZ Slaves were a huge influence in the constitution. The whole south was very stubborn about this fact. They insisted that slave trade had to continue for another 20 years. Madison didn't agree with slave trade. He thought it was very wrong. Also, many argued that the people needed to be those who approve the laws or to deny the laws. This was so that tyranny would be avoided. So the power needed to stay in the hands of the people. I think this is why it is so important that citizens choose to inform themselves and vote on important issues. Thank goodness we have such a wicked awesome government organizationZ Both the small states and the large states were very stubborn. They didn't want to compromise at all. But roger Sherman devised a part that involved both of the interests of the small states and the large states. But they didn't like that idea at first. Which made it very difficultX . It was a little complicated about the rules that went into the convention They had to say \"aye\" or \"nay\" to vote. And they would say with dissent if they disagreed. The chairman also had to give permission for someone to speak If they spoke out of Turn they would get silenced. turn* They also needed a majority to have the votes go through and actually get approved. There were so many different ideas being sent out in the mertingZ Meeting But all the sacrifice of the founding fathers was for us the people. Their future. I personally think they did a really good job. Our government isn't perfect but it's something really really good. Wicked awesome is a way to describe it if you live in New England. The best England. England is a cool place but New England is the better one. It's like the 2.0 of countries. New England also survives worse winters. We are stronger. And we speaker with a wicked awesome accent. I have no idea what else to talk about. I'm running out of ideas and thoughts. Probably because I'm so tired. I'm sure the transportation for this convention I was talking about would be hard. It was probably horse and buggy but it would take so many hours to get from New York to Pen. Imagine Seattle to NYC. That would take months I feel like. At least weeks. Maybe not months. I guess it depends how slow you take the trip. If you stay in a hotel it would take a lot longer. Especially because of the really nice continental breakfast they give you. And the beds are usually really nice. Hopefully you have the money for it all or else it would be very hard. There would also be really good costumer service. That's a necessary thing. It's a super important part of the marketing of a company. If a company doesn't have good costumer service not much else matters because that is so important. Also, usually there is a pool and you get to swim. I love swimming. And I love potatoes. They are wicked awesome. Also the new towels are great. It's really hard to do things when you're tired. Sleep tight! Don't let the bed bugs bite!",

Happens to me all the time. I feel bad when I return and there's this long stream of conversation that I missed. But what do you do? You don't want to keep the other person waiting, but you do want to talk. It's a fickle little game we play. But it feels wrong to abuse the system. Not that I am! I promise, I'm not. I'm just making conversation with myself, I suppose. I wonder if this is how the top scorer got to where he is. He just opens empty chat boxes and chats and chats. I've met him, I think. He types really quickly. He's the only person I've seen that makes me nervous to try to talk to. He just types SO quickly. It's ridiculous. I don't know how he does it, but he does, and then I'm left scrambling to catch up with him. Ah, well. You're probably not around. That's all right. If you return and want to chat, odds are, I'll be in the waiting queue. See you then! I could, in theory, remain here, but it seems hokey to me, and it's a little rude to everyone else. So I won't. See you around, for real this time.",

        "body": "Everyone loves the songs, but I'm not super into listening to the sound tracks. Yeah, we used to live in Germany so we went to London for a vacation. We took advantage of our time in Europe by trying to tour all over. It is actually rainy in London most of the time. It kind of sucked because our hotel room smelled like mold a little. When I woke up, I was too lazy and comfortable to get up and change the channel of the TV, so I watched a marathon of Thomas the Train until my dad got up. He eventually changed the channel. Then, the continental breakfast had bread, but the toaster burnt out bread. I can't complain, though, because I found a five pound bill on the ground near the train station when we went site seeing. So, I bought a feather pen from a souvenir shop. It was pretty cool. I didn't buy any ink though because I didn't have enough money. I was only in like third grade so... Did you take a nap or something? Where did you go? I still have some homework I have to finish, but I don't want to do it. I have to write a paper and finish some chemistry. The midterms  were crazy yesterday. Are you still there? It'd be kind of weird if you were still reading all of this, but just weren't responding. I don't really mind though. I'm kind of good at rambling I guess. Do you want to proof read my essay? I bet that'll put you to sleep. I wrote about fashion and its influences. I ate all of my carrots so now I want something else to eat. I'm kind of thirsty actually. Maybe I'll have some orange juice or something. Apple juice sounds really good right now. Or maybe some apple cider. My brother is wearing plaid right now. Are you there? My house mate just poured me some apple cider. It was very good. I love apple juice. I tried to be sly and offer it to someone but they didn't get the hint and ask for some so I didn't get to share with them. It was still good though. That was last year. Now, I try to impress them with my art. Are you still there? Should I send some help? I'm a little concerned. I don't even know you but I feel responsible for your well being because I was probably the last person you were talking too. Just kidding, hopefully you are okay. I think I have tendonitis and typing a lot does not help it. It makes my elbow hurt. I know that sounds weird but its true. I feel bad because I was supposed to type up a bunch of generated random numbers for a group project, but I forgot and someone else already did it by the time I got home. I was at the church building. That is where I had my desserts because the church always has refreshments, not that it's a bad thing. I'm just saying. At least I had some vegetables to balance it out. It probably doesn't work that way though. Since you don't seem to be here anymore, I might just end the chat. It's almost time for me to go to bed anyways. I also should get some stuff done. My brother dropped his pencil. I don't know why I felt the need to tell you. I feel like I'm just talking to myself because you are not responding. If you do come back from your bathroom break, please do not go through all of the effort of reading everything I typed. I don't think it is worth your time. You know as they say, \"Time is money.\" Who is they, because I do not know. Okay, I better give my tendonitis arms a break. Nice chatting with you though. I hope you have a nice rest of the day. I guess evening. I need to go to bed now. Bye.",

        "parent_body": "Oh I didn't know that! That sounds super interesting. So are you wanting to write books or what kind of publishing are you wanting to get into after graduating? A lot of my extended family have written books! Mostly my grandpa My cousin actually just wrote a futuristic  fiction book that sounds pretty interesting. My wife and I have always wanted to create a cookbook We are really big foodies! One of my favorite dishes is a Mushroom, onion, and Swiss cheese smothered chicken. We just made it up last week and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it! My wife usually does the cooking and makes up these amazing recipes and I do most of the baking. I really love to bake probably because I really enjoy science. I guess you kind of have to enjoy science when you are taking so many science classes. Dental school has pretty strict science requirements. Did you have to take any science classes for your generals? If so, what was your favorite? My favorite science class so far has been physics! It is just so fun and I just feel Like it is pretty easy for me to understand. Surprisingly enough, I have two professors for that class. It's a couple! I have never had a class like that before! Have you ever had a couple teach any of your classes? I was curious, so I just looked up how much BYU professors earn and it's actually really good! If both husband and wife are Professor, they make quite a good living. I don't know why I was curious. I've never even thought about becoming a professor. But maybe someday it would be pretty rewarding to be able to give back and teach at a denta School. My cousin's husband is going to school to be a professor of the Spanish language. Actually I think he actually wants to teach Professors how to teach the language. It is a pretty cool concept. They are living in Minnesota right now and just had there fourth child. Our babies are 6 months apart. I wish they lived closer so we could have play dates. It's kind of sad because all of my son's cousins live in a different state. I am really hoping we can go to dental school in Arizona where all of our family lives. Are you there? Alright gotta go",

I wonder if it would apply to regular animals not just pets becuase then i would want to talk to every animal that  i saw. I would just be talking to any birds on the side of the street, any stray dogs and of course little bugs that are everywhere I would definitely be very happy because I adore animals and being able to effectively communicate with them would only make me like them even more Now I wonder if anyone is actually looking at these messages that I am posting Hi there!!! I hope that you are having a wonderful day!! My day wasn't terrible nor was it fantastic, but that's how most days are and It's definitely way better than a totally tear wrenching bad day so I'll take it This is kind of cracking me up and I don't know if someone decided to leave the chat and for some reason  I wasn't told that they left and now I'm just talking to myself. I think the funnier option is that whoever you are are just reading these crazy messages and just wondering what the heck has gotten into my mind I swear I am not crazy!! I wonder if I am even getting any points for this conversation  i am having with myself that would be pretty sweet if I am talking seriously we'll see, I am not ready to give up this chat just yet feel free to join in any time other person!!! There's still a spot for you to join in in this one sided conversation lolololo Okay welp this has been awkward and I am sorry to have bugged you if anyone has been on the other line this entire time but It is high time that I get up and leave this conversation Farewell my good friend.. I'll always remember you....",

And medically induced comas are recoverable, right? I guess I don't know a lot about them, just what I've seen in movies. Which is honestly probably not real. Oh well. They're still fun movies to watch! Like Captain America! Except he doesn't go into a medically induced coma. It's more like an ice-induced coma. So I don't know if that counts. Although, maybe cryo-sleep type things can count as medically induced comas? Because that's kinda like a coma, right? I guess I don't know much about comas in general. How are they different from sleep? Do you dream during them? Or do you just wake up one day and you're awake?",

        "body": "If money were no object.. I have gotten this prompt half a billion times. It's like every other prompt that I get. But if money were not an object, I would travel the world. Starting with going and visiting Europe. And then probably going to Asia. I think it would be cool to see France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Greece. You know. The typical ones. And then I could go visit Turkey and Bosnia and then head over to Asia. Then I could visit Nepal, Thailand, China and Japan. Those are all super cool countries. And it would not be a cheap trip because I would try all the foods of those cultures and countries. So this would probably take about 10 years to do depending on how long I want to stay in each country I would also have to go see different monuments and the typical touristy things. And I would need to do a lot of exercise so I dont get super fat. Obviously the food is the best part. Also I would probably want to take my brother or someone to have some company or else it would be very boring I think. So...what would you do? Where would you go? What would be the best part? Anything you would look forward to if you did a trip like the one that I described? Also, if you had all the money in the world, would you go on a trip around the world or would you do something else? Also, what is or favorite flavor of ice cream? I think chocolate mint is wicked good. And I would need to try all the types of food in Italy. Especially all the different types of pizza. Not just the plain pizzas but the really extravagant ones. And I would need to exercise a lot. Probably in all of the countries I'd be in, I would need a gym membership. I might also need security guards for some of the more dangerous countries around the world Also, they would need to be well trained just because you don't want some crazy guy as your security guard. They would probably be really buff guys. Maybe even Russians Maybe I hired them along the way on the trip. Also, what is your absolute favorite food? Oh! If I went to Spain I would eat all the Spanish food possible there. Fabada, cachopo, chorizo, paella, mariscos those are all super good types of food. Also, I would have to go the the Canary Islands and eat mojo and papas canarias And gofio with honey and milk. And drink clipper everyday for weeks while staying on the beach. There are a lot of hippies that live on the beaches there but I wouldn't do that. I would live in a hotel or an apartment. I would probably go and stay in Tenerife. That would be really cool. Or you could say wicked awesome too. Also, do you know why the fish is super expensive on the Canary Islands?? They import all of it! How ridiculous! Because they also fish there. So its a little crazy it's I would have to go to Galicia and eat octopus and caldo gallego. And go to Ponferrada to eat food typical of the Bierzo. Like botillo. It's a pig bladder stuffed with chorizo and pig tail and sometimes tongue. It sounds terrible but it is actually really really good. I would have to do a huge tour of Spain because there is so much to do there. Also I would go to a barcalona verus Real Madrid game. Those get intense. But, money is an object so all these dreams are pretty extreme. But it would be sooooooo cool! I'm wondering how I can make it possible. Have you ever been to Spain? Most people here think it is a third world country but it's a super nice country. Their economy isn't the greatest right now but it's getting better I think. Or at least I hope that it is getting better... So, have you ever been to Spain? You have to go see it! Well visit it. And stay awhile. Because it's a lot of fun. There's a lot of cool architecture to see from earlier centuries. Would that interest you? I got to go! See you!",

Every wild pig would take to the sky Tusks raging It would be terrifying Especially because the pigs would be massive Because why not? They would be the size of buildings Just like in Percy Jackson book five If I do remember correctly The world would be in utter turmoil All mankind would be in mortal terror of the monsters Soon elephants would follow suit Behemoths with tusks the size of skyscrapers Outer space would be no obstacle They would fly all over the solar system Colonizing planets everywhere they went Jupiter would be their base because it is biggest It would be the Texas of the solar system For obvious reasons Every animal on Earth would eventually grow wings Flying great white sharks would make sharknado a reality Flying blue whales would scoop up huge flocks of pigeons Instead of krill Which would also fly in the air and feed on bugs So bats would be out of a job Deep sea creatures would eventually migrate to Venus Where they could withstand the high pressures Birds would no longer feel special for having wings So they would feel sad But they would eventually come to accept the new order of things Komodo dragons would grow wings as well And there really would be flying dragons Now wouldn't that be something I would get myself a flying panda Whom I would name Murphy And together we would travel the world wherever we wished We could visit his cousins in China And visit mount kilimanjaro Without having to hike to the top manually People all over the world would travel via flying animals Planes would become much less popular Horses would once again become popular modes of travl But planes would still be fastest So they would still be used, of course Just not as much as they are nowadays People in Africa would get flying giraffes and lions So everybody would be jealous of them Anything would be possible The OASIS would be a real thing Except the world would be awesome Not a dystopia, because that would be no good Wizards would be needed to protect everyone from these flying creatures So Harry Potter would be real The mascot of Hogwarts would be a flying hog Now, what else would be possible? A bridge would be built from New York to England It would be like the bridge from China to Hong Kong Except way bigger, obviously... And all countries would just get along with each other So big projects like that could be done A colony would get started on the moon! If pigs could fly, then why not that? The James Webb telescope would be launched And we could image extrasolar planets and such And do some terraforming on Mars Put some oceans back there But back to the pigs... They would be flying No doubt about it And they would feel so free and jubilant Aw man, my class is almost over I must return to the world of transit Goodbye, chatting world! I shall return again at the soonest moment of convenience Later!",

But it's really cold outside and I don't like the coldz Cold I freeze in this weatherx Weather I prefer the nice hot weather. Humidity is nice too. Also snow is cool but...I don't like the cold that has to acompany it But shoveling isnt all that cool. It's a great work out but super hard. I'm always sore afterwords. Do you know how to cook? I don't cook all that well. But I do alright. I don't starve that's for sure. I make cookies and Mac and cheese and Ramon. Those are my specialty. Have you ever cooked any of those? It's fairly simplez Simple. Excuse my mistypes. But they taste great when you are starving that's for sure. I also love ice cream. And gelato Gelato is way better than ice cream though It's a lot more rich and it is denser. I like the texture more. Yellow cake batter is the best. And mint brownies is good too. And cookies and cream. What is your favorite type of ice cream? I think you would really enjoy the ones that I like. Because they are the best flavors for sure.",

A question that I'm actually not quite sure how to answer I'm not closely familiar with any particular charities I think humanitarian work in 3rd world countries is great Helping people with better nutrition, clean water, education, etc. There are many organizations that engage in undertakings like that It's probably bad that I'm having this much trouble thinking of any by name Of course, I know the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints does a lot of work like that I also think helping people who have lost their homes to natural disasters is a great cause There have been lots of natural disasters in the United States recently I mean, there have been lots of natural disasters EVERYWHERE, for that matter... And everyone ought to be helped I would also support charitable organizations that help couples adopt children Adoption agencies? Those are important Less important, but still important, are animal care centers and rescue shelters that help get animals to good homes Now what else is there.... I can't think of any that don't involve helping unfortunate people or lost animals But I suppose that's what philanthropy is all about I think I may have donated to a hospital once You know, I left some coins in a jar at some place one time When it come to being \"passionate\" about a particular one, I'm afraid I don't have a clear answer And the question says MOST passionate.... Like I'm supposed to be passionate about multiple causes I'm a terrible human being Just kidding I don't think that I just think I need to get more involved with that charitable and philanthropic stuff I wonder what the best way to go about that would be I guess I could just Google it and look up \"philanthropic causes\" And stuff like that Philanthropy always reminds me of Studio C The old episode sketch they did with the Facebook Philanthropist Who \"liked\" worthy causes That was good stuff I could get behind that cause Although I don't use Facebook very much So I would probably be no good at that philanthropic cause either Woe is me The terrible human Who isn't involved in charity The end!!!!!!",

Things they should consider changing on chit chat: Notification settings They should make multiple notifications that remind people like every minute until they see that there is someone online. I'm not sure which film had the biggest impact on me though most recently I think Avengers  lest an impression on me though.  I was just upset with the poor thinking of our worlds smartest and best hero's.  Like come on guys, you had a 5-1 lead on Thanos with the infinity stones. In other news, I'm curious to hear your opinion on the new schedule for church meetings on Sundays. 2 hour time blocks!  I'm pretty excited honestly.  I think the 10 minute drop in Sacrament will be good, talks will be more meaningful and the time will be maximized better now in my opinion. I'm going to end this chat and just wait for a new one!  Nice talking with you chitchatter23!",

Your life could be better than this!\" I think it's important to know what's going on in the world It helps you develop empathy Now as far as fictional films go... Hmmmm Also from my film class, we watched \"The General\" Very old movie from 1926, but totally hilarious It changed the way I view older film Ok....I've just given a long explanation in answer to this question I suppose I could retype all of it Why not.... It's still going! The same question! I suppose it is an interesting question, though NOT AGAIN EVERY TIME IT'S THE SAME QUESTION But that is ok Yes Ok indeed I am a patient soul Who is quite patient indeed Oh, the joy!

        "body": "Hello! I only have a little bit before my class starts Is anyone there? Or am I just going to talk with chitchatter23 instead? Anyways, I just got finished taking both my quiz and test for my Bio class. Brutal stuff.  I am a CS major and honestly just don't care about biology.  But, that's no excuse for not acing the class. I did somewhat decent.  With the extra credit we can get I should have a nice grade in that class. To answer the prompt, I would probably be really sad.  Probably would go do lots of fun things for a little bit.  Drive to Disneyland and ride some rides.  And then since I can't fly a plane I would probably attempt to do that Ultimately crashing an no longer being by myself :) purely an accident of course due to my terrible flying. Then I wouldn't have to worry about being alone anymore. I'm really curious as to if people with serious depression see things in that light.  That's really sad.. I think that's why it's so tough for them to function. I've been reading up a lot on depression recently.  Very interesting topic and I know quite a few people struggling with it. On a brighter note:  my parents flew into town last night, a day earlier than I was expecting.  So I get to go out to lunch with my mom today. Should be a lot of fun! Random thought, one of my favorite things to do is casually stroll through the Talmage and just look at the freshmen stressing out over projects they're struggling with. And then proceed to help out if needed :) I really enjoy helping out with classes i've already taken, partly because it's so much easier to do having done like 3 levels of courses above that which they're studying, but it's also fun teaching people to program. I think that if all else fails, I wouldn't mind being a professor one day.  Granted, I'd probably have to get like a masters or PhD.  But still would be fun. I think maybe if I can just be super successful in my field then they would be willing to let me teach without multiple degrees and stuff. Okay, well I have to go.  It's been nice chatting with you chitchatter23.  Talk to you later.",

I was in Russia, in a city near St. Petersburg, and I was looking for my friend, because we got separated when I got off the bus a stop earlier than he was expecting. As I was walking towards where the next bus stop was, I saw an another friend, an Armenian, who was standing on the street with one of his buddies. I said, \"Hey, how's it going?\" And he introduced me to his friend. We had a good chat, then all of a sudden we were surrounded by about 10 more Armenian guys, sporting leather jackets and gold chains and so on. They were all really confused to see me in the middle of their meeting. My friend (the Armenian) told me I should probably go, so they could discuss some important business. And that's how I ended up in the middle of a meeting of the Armenian mob in that city. Right as I was walking away, my friend (the American one) turned the corner. He said he was really worried about what would happen to me. But he was glad that I made it out alright. I was glad for that, too. Especially because these guys were scary. What's the craziest thing you've ever done? Hello? You there?",

It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself... Well that was fun I guess.

        "body": "Hi, how are you? I'm not quite sure if I'm just supposed to chat with myself, but I'll tell a story. One day there was a girl whose hair had the power to heal the sick.  A wicked witch found out about this little girl's ability and kidknapped her. The witch locked the girl in a tower that had no doors nor stairs. After many years, the girl's hair grew and grew until it was long enough for a person to climb to the top of the tower using it as a ladder. When her hair had reached that length, a handsome prince happened to be riding his horse nearby. Now, the little girl had been practicing her singing since she didn't have much to do up in her tower and had a beautiful voice. While the prince was riding near the tower, he could hear the what he thought was the voice of an angel.  Upon hearing such a voice, he could not help but sing along. Unfortunately, the young prince did not have the time to practice singing nor had anyone told him that his void was horrid, so when the girl heard what sounded like a dying bird, she peered out the window. She gasped when she saw the prince for she had never seen a man before.  She called out to him asking what that noise was. \"It was my singing,\" he replied. \"That is no singing!\" She yelled back.  \"Here, come up to my tower and I will teach you how to sing.\"  So she let down her hair and beckoned him to climb to the top. The prince made it to the top of the tower and they began his voice lessons.  It was not long, however, when the wicked witch returned.  \"Let down your hair!\" She yelled up to the girl. With another gasp, the girl said, \"Coming!\" \"Quick, hide!\" she told the prince, for the witch would not allow for strangers to be in her tower. With the prince hidden, she let down her hair and allowed the witch to enter.  \"Hmm, you seem odd today, girl.\" The witch said as she entered the window, \"almost, happy.  I don't like it, I don't like it one bit!  You have someone here with you, don't you?!\" The prince yelped in surprise of the witches knowledge of him.  The witch heard the yelp and uncovered the prince, who was hiding under the bed. Thinking quickly the girl yelled to the prince \"Sing!\" The prince started to sing with his cringe worthy voice, \"Lalalala!\" The witch cringed and stumbled back by sheer all the way until she fell out the window. \"Oh no!\" the two gasped together. \"I hope she is okay!\" said the prince. \"She landed on some bushed, she's knocked out but she'll be fine,\" responded the girl as she peered out the window again. \"Well then, I should get going then,\" said the prince. \"Can I come with you!\" said the girl. \"Sure, but how are we going to get out of this tower?\" Asked the prince. They put their heads together and formulated a plan.  Using their combined smarts, they cut the girl's hair and wove it into a ladder.  Now they both could escape and make it on their way. When the witch woke up she was furious but then noticed the ladder made of hair.  \"The magic that girl possessed resided in that hair.  Hmm, I wonder why I didn't just cut it in the first place and keep all the hair to my self.  I'll let them go then and live here with the magic hair.\" She said. The prince and the girl rode off together in the sunset.  \"I never got your name fair maiden,\" the prince asked. \"Repunzel\" she responded. \"Wow!\" He gasped, \"You're the long lost princess!  You're my sister!\"",

Really good stuff hmm okay I'm just going to practice my typing then And during hte few moments that we have left, we want ot have just an off the ocuff chat betwene you and me -- us. We want to talk right down to earth in a language that everybody here can easily understand. We all agree tonight, all of the speakers have agreed, that america has a very serious problem. Not only does American have a very serious problem, but our people have a very serious problem, American problem is us. We're her problem. The only reason she has a problem is she doesn't want us here. And every time you look at yourself, be you black, borwn, red or yellow -- a so called Negro -- you represent a person who poses such a serious problem for America you're not wanted. Once you face this a fact, then you can start plotting a course that will make you appear intelligent, instead of unintelligent. What you and I need to do is learn to forget our differences. When we come together, we don't come together as Baptists or Methodists. You don't catch hell  cause you're a Baptist, and you don't catch hell cause you're a Methodist. You don't catch hell cause you're a Methodist or Baptis. you don't catch hell because you're a Democrat or a Republican. You don't catch hell because you're a Mason or an Elk. And you sure don don't catch hell cause you're an American. cause if you was an American, you woudln't cath no hell/ You catch hell cause you're black man. You catch hell, all of us catch hell, for the same reason. So we are all black people, so called, second-class citizens, ex slaves. You are nothing but a ex slave. You don't like to be Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the AMerican people and to address their concerns, their hope and their optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission, to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieve extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected and others we could have never imagined we have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul and the steel in America's spine. Each test forged new American heroes ot remind us who we are and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas Strip. We hear tales of Americans, like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery , with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters int eh scene used for Hurrican Harvey. 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee barved power lines -- downed power lines and deep water to save 40 lives. Ashlee , we all thank you . Thank you ver much. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped in a California summer camp, threatened by those devastating wildfires. to everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, everywhere, we are with you , we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. Thank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very muc much, David. Great job. Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this house, a guy and was back to work three and ahalf months later. The legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. I think they like, Steve. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic of the capitol police police officers, the Alexandria police and the doctors, nurses and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others and some in this room -- of many others, some in this room. In the aftermath of that terible shooitng we came together, not as Republicans or Democratics, but as representatives of the people. But it is is not enough to come together only in times of. Tragedy. Tonigh, I call on all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are teh people we are elected. to serve. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always know. That no people on are so fearless or daring or determined as Ammericans. if there is a mountian, we climb it. if there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it. Let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our union is strong, because our people are strong. And together we are building a safe, strong, and proud America. Since the election, we have created 2.4 Million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in mmanufacturing alone. T Tremendous. After years and years of wages stagnation.  we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45 year low. And something I am very proud of: African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And hispanic-American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in hisotyr. Small business confidence is at an all time high. The stock market has smashed one record after anohter, gaining a trillion dollars and more in value in just this short period of time. the great news for Americans: 401k retirement, pension, and college savings accoutns have gone through th the roof. And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted teh biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business to lower tax rates for hard working Americnas. We nearly doubled the standard deducation for everyone. Now, the first earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making will see their tax bill reduced by 200 slashing their tax bill in half. In April this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system. And millions of Americans will h have more take home pay, starting next month. A lot more We eliminated an especially and especially cruel tax on Americans making less than a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalities, simply because they could not afford gove government ordered health plans. We reprealed the cored of the disastrous obamacare, the individual mandate is now gone Thank you We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent, all the way down to 20 to 21 percent. So american companies can compete against anyone, anywhere else in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than a lot of money small business have also received a massive tav cut, and now can deduct 20 percent of their buissnes income.

I liked Boston We almost stumbled across American history everyday We were able to go to the Boston pops firework show too. It was very American We also went up to Maine and then down to Connecticut for two separate weekends Both were really neat It's amazing how the east coast can be so diverse The lighthouses in Maine were so old and very picturesque against the rocky New England coast line I kind of wish we had lobster out there My wife really isn't into sea food but she said that she would try it out there because it was so fresh it was just so expensive And overall, we had no regrets We also learned a lot about how to deal with a lot of rain. It would pour somedays and we had to figure out how to still get to work, be outside in the rain Have you ever been to Boston? We also did some hikes while we were out there Since my wife and I had been living in Utah for the past couple of years we missed having good mountainy hikes And rocks in general Kind of weird huh? We found some good hike though They definately weren't like any up American Fork Canyon but there were goood At the top they had to build a little stand so you could see up over everything So it wasn;t much of a mountain but it was still good So am I supposed to just talk to myself on this thing? It seems like half of the time I starting chatting and nothing happens That's ok though I kind of want that ipad or macbook But there are several people who have a lot of points already haha oh well I guess I mean how to you almost have 2 million points on day two? Crazy! So question. Do you think it would be fun to be subadiver instructor? *scuba diver I think it would extra fun especially if I lived out in Hawaii or the Caribbean You know?",

It would almost mean that they inquired a soul--which is really weird to think about. test test So the chat box wouldn't show that I typed anything. Thus the tests Now it's working I think if computers started asking not to be turned off then they would potentially have the capabilities to do a lot of other useful tasks too. I wonder if they would like doing less meaningful jobs and instead turn philosophical in nature. I bet they would eventually ask why they would need to continue serving humans And then you have a total dooms days situation where computers might start taking over the world! Then again, at the current status of neural networks, it is really easy to fool a network because they attach to bias data. If that is still the case, I think humans would still have a fighting chance.",

I love that feeling because I worked my shift and now it's time to go home and it's just a very nice feeling to have. Do you understand the feeling that I am emulating? Does your mind comprehend the complexity of the situation  and the gravity of the malevolence of bosses? According to the National Geographic Weather, the estimation of their predictable circumstances have generated a theory that Utah weather is more inclined to be cold. The inclination of this cold weather is owed to the fact that Utah is just a cold state in the winter and winter is the season we are approaching. I am really hungry by the way. I have hardly eaten anything all day and now my stomach is just growling with pain. It's not a very good idea to not eat that much. I didn't eat breakfast, lunch, and I am going home to eat dinner which makes coming home especially nice. You don't seem to be replying to me. Are you there or are you away from the keyboard? Why is it that you are not replying to me? This is supposed to be a two way conversation. If not, I am going to get bored, and I will not have anybody to talk to, so if you could please talk to me, I would very much appreciate it. Can you please talk to me please? I am still waiting for you to reply to me. If you find me annoying, you can just end the chat. I understand if you don't want to talk with me. I mean, I wouldn't really understand because you haven't met me and I haven't met you. There shouldn't be any reason as to why you don't want to talk to me. Well, since you insist on being quiet, then I just retreat into the abyss. I meant to say that I must retreat to the abyss. Thank you for not talking with me.",

Anyway the most interesting thing I've learned recently is that if you intervene too much in your kids life, like if they are fighting with a sibling and you immediately break it up without letting them have a disagreement then they will never learn how to properly resolve conflicts. They wont learn the necessary communication skills to hear the other persons point of view while also supporting their own in a mutually respectful way. Which can lead to problems later on when they are married or in more serious relationships where disagreements can happen and often do.",

And I don't know what to do about that. She's a really sweet girl. And I like meeting with her. I just, I don't know. I don't know how this is going to work out. She's not the first person I've tutored, but she IS one of the first where she wasn't really interested in learning the concepts. And the main difference is, the other people are willing to stay as long as they need until we've made sure that they're clear. She'll ditch as soon as class ends. It's okay. I don't blame her. I really don't think she enjoys it, so it's no surprise that she doesn't want to stay in a place where she dislikes everything. And if she never wants to touch math the rest of her life, that's fine. Not everyone needs to be a math major. But . . . we gotta survive high school. Dunno how that's going to happen.",

        "body": "Hi! How are you doing? I am so tired, just finished up with classes for the day and need to start working in a little bit. I think they need to fix chit chat so that you can also talk with Eve too when people aren't available If it's truly an AI project then it should be able to carry on at least very basic conversations and learn from the responses it gets during those conversations. But I'm not in charge so maybe not hahah I'm assuming you are either very distracted right now or in a class. Or maybe a mixture of both haha I really hope they outline the scoring rules for this round soon so we know what kinds of points we have to hit before the next session starts I'm just talking to myself. Maybe I could run a dilema by you (myself). I am prepping for an interview where they want me to use languages that I haven't programmed in for a while now.  I can easily explain the logic and process of all the problems I will probably get, but I won't be able to write them up perfectly I'm predicting Should I use a language that's closely related that I know how to code up perfectly to solve their questions, or should I use one of their preferred languages and probably... ...screw up a lot of the syntax? Anyways, it was good talking to you.  I feel kind of bad getting lots of points while you don't profit at all from this conversation since you aren't paying attention. But, that's just the way it is.  Talk to you later. Bye!",

Even requiring a scooter license in order to use public scooters? I really like Taiwan's ubike system which uses an easy card scanner in order to unlock and lock up bikes at designated  ubike sites. In order to use ubikes an individual would have to register their card with their telephone number. Depending on how long the ubike was used for determined pricing. 50 cents for every half hour or so. So for scooters having a more strict set up policy as well as somehow maintaining gas levels ...Well if we are going for lower CC, then we could go with electric scooters and having the lock stands be automatic charge stations...I believe it could be quite useful!",

I would definitely try to have more pets I would have a guinea pig a bird a cat more dogs, a capybara, a duck, a koala, every sort of animal I would try to have It would be almmost a zoo at my house!1 I could probably make money off of it tho!! Think about it!! The incredible talking zooo! Everyone would come for miles to see these talking animals Only then I would feel sad that the animals would be caged up and not in their natural habitat and then I would feel really sad for them perhaps its not so great of an idea Idk do you like animals?? What do you think of a talking animal zoo? do you think its humane? Idk are you even listening to me? YOu probably aren't but I've done this a lot of times before I just love talking to myself lol its the best its fantastic 10 points if you can name the movie where its from I can wait Oh yeah, it's from nacho libre that s one of my favorite movies do you have afavorite movie? If so what is it? Where was it made? When was it made? HOw was it made? Who was it made? Why was it made? tellll meeee I want to know everything there is to know about this movie here I don't know that much about nacho libre so I cant tell you much about it I also love emporers new groove, napolean dynamite, jumanji, i got a bunch of movies that  Ireally like disney movies are pretty good too wbu? huh I haven't heard anything interesting from you allday!!! tell mee! I'm on the edge of my seat waiting to hear a response from you ohhh nameless one!! What should I call you then??? Oh great one I guess I won't call you anything because you arent' answering me and I guess that is just fine if you dont wanna name you wont get a name I'll jsut sit here waiting  for a resposne you see this is me waiting for a response I want a response haha I hope if htere is someone on this actually that I am not being that desperate, idk this is just a little entertaining for me maybe a little bit for you too lololo anyways thsi has been great talking to you I'm not leaving just yet tho You're not getting rid of me that easily I'll just type random things here I like rock n roll I like talking to new people as well I might be going on a mission in a year or too.  I want to go on a performing mission in nauvoo would be cool I really like performing and it sounds like a lot of fun there I'm not sure how good I would be a ta regular mission I'll definitely try my best if i do go It just depends whats the right thing for me to d o But here is a super long message about how I want to win this competition because  i ahve a virus on my computer and cant afford a new one I want to at least try for this super hard because my dad recieved a pay cut and can't pay for a lot of my schooling i want to pay for as much as I can but no one would hire me and when they did they treated me kind of horribly I've also applied for a bunch of scholarships but to no avail unfortunately It's really sad because I've worked so hard but it hasnt worked out so well so i really want to try really hard at this and maybe  Iwont have to pay for a new computer But then again  Iam going against 1000's of other kids that have the same goal some might need it even more than me but i really want to try so i can have one part of my college life payed for I am honestly just praying I can reach the top and recieve this laptop it would honestly be a prayer answerred and here i am ranting to someone who isn't even listening and then there is that guy that has a whole whopping 9 million points will i get disqualified if i copy and paste stuff? I am pretty high up hto, it's better than 1000 place right?? I will at least get a box of chocolates which will be better than recieving nothing so I'll just try my best to get that maybe looks like you cant copy and paste I wasn't going to do a whole lot of it, maybe just a few times but how long has this contest been open??? How long has number 0 guy been working at getting these points, he must have been doing this for a long time or  it could be a she too, I feel bad that I automatically assume that it is a boy It seems more like boy initials idk maybe its girl initials I'm also wondering if i have talked to this person and if  I liked talking to them who knows maybe you're the mystery person and you are just reading this do you get points if you don't say anything andthe other person is the only person talking?? Idk because I'm sure if someone doesn't respond in ten minutes then they leave the chat then some people dont know that they ended the chat and they keep talking to themselves but I mean  I'm getting points forit so that s nice I wonder if anyone else is doing this as well I mean its pretty smart You dont have to wait for any responses you just get to type like you are having a 2 sided conversation with yourself almost I think its a pretty good idea but what if it doesn't count towards the prizes that would really stink but then I am kind of still providing information for this eve bot btw I'm sure she's going to be awesom I wonder if this is going to be a real thing or if they are just doing this for ideas if it will actually be up and running someday and like how much will they cost I hope they don't eavesdrop like alexa, that would be interesting I would not like that very much I mean who honestly likes being eavesdropped on tho everyone that does raise your hand so I can take a count Oh wow, the majority votes that they don't like it very much with one vote MEEEE Wow, we think so much alike Morghan!! Too bad you can't put out your instagram then we can always talk and be best friends forever!! Oh wait.  I'm talking to myself :( No wonder I have no friends lol jkskskjjkjk I have friends, I'm just pretending to be a doofus Don't take me seriously guys please I hope that I am just racking up the points here I really would like to get as many points as i can There was one person that only had like one chat but it had like 400 thousand points It was pretty cool i wonder if they are doing this to get their points you dont have to wait for other people to reply because sometimes it takes a long time for them to reply i also wonder if any of my friends are doing this they probably arent as hardcore as me lol I'm in this for the win and i think I am doing pretty good so far I'm not sure tho I have got a long way to go How far is a good way to go?? Should I go all out in this and do this only for the next few days or should i not do this I am almost done with finals so thats really good i guess I need to keep checking my points and see if i am going up very slowly maybe i should talk to an actual person that sounds like a good idea maybe I will try a real person chat just for fun I'll also keep this one because you know this morghan fellow seems pretty cool How's eve doing today?? Has she been created yet? Has she had a good day? EEEEeeEEEEeeEEeEeEvvvve walleEeeeEEEeeeEEeeeeEEE aaaa a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a That seemed to give me afew points but not a whole lot i guess",

I mean he wrote half of them when he was deaf! How cool is that? And moonlight sonata is one of the most beautiful pieces ever written for piano ever. I'm actually trying to learn how to play it right now. But I don't have a lot of time to practice. It kinda stinks. But one day I will learn it! I need a piano first. They are wicked expensive. But sometimes you can find free ones on the internet. The only problem is that you would need a truck to pick it up. And we don't have a truck either But one day we will have a truck too. The only problem is that they cost a lot of money too. Anyway, that's enough chatting for one day. Good luck and I wish you the best in all your lives endeavors. Good bye.",

I would want to motivate people to work towards something worthwhile rather than just sit and take handouts all day. I would maybe write a book or become a public speaker to accomplish this. Then, maybe on the weekends I would go dune riding or boating in the summer. Just relaxing with the family is really the best that life has to offer in my opinion.

What about the neighborhood Walmart, though?  If you went all the way to Orem, though, that would be further than TJ Max. But even then, it wouldn't be terrible. I love you! I'm going to go ahead and close this.  Thanks for chatting with me! Love you!",

I like to do that with you, but it might not work out this time. I'm not sure though; I'll let you know after your game today where I stand with my homework. As far as job searching goes, I'm considering TJ Maxx. It would be fun and dynamic, they pay $9.75 on average so it's not too low, and I'd probably get discounts. And we'd really benefit from that, let me tell you! Haha. That or the big Walmart in Orem. I think the pay is similar, and we could always use discounts from a place at which we frequently shop. I'm not sure though. Walmart is farther than TJ Maxx and night not be as enjoyable. I'd have to consider the work environment.",

But, to be honest, the only time I've seen where someone isn't active right when I open the window and still resumes the conversation later was when she was bored waiting - for her roommates to show up after the game. Beyond that, it's never happened. I don't want to tilt the scores, though, not when I'm not actually chatting. So, um, I guess I'll say good night. Errr, good bye, I meant. I hope we can see each other again soon! I'd really like to be able to talk to you instead of, you know, talking while your screen is open but you aren't actually reading. So we'll see, eh?

Hah I think that CPUs and processing still has a lot of things that they can do though. Speed isn't the only thing that they can do to increase productivity in things. For instance, adding cores is something that will allow multiple processes to happen. This will allow things to become quicker and quicker even though the speed itself isn't actually increasing. Or things like multiple monitors, innovations that will allow you to be more productive are still out there. I don't think we are near as productive as we can be on our computers.

Who knows, I might even give you a good rank Romeo, romeo, wherefore art thou romeo? Art thou available at the moment? I shall keep typing until I get a response, because I am nothing if not persistant There are many things in this world that give people questions Like what exactly started the fashion of people being proud of bruises? I have no idea, but I am a part of the trend, Bruises and scars are battle wounds To be shown off proudly To anyone who will listen to your story Oh, the woes and the worries they will show But it isn't of any major importance to most Some of the people I talk to just don't respond, which is strange, because that is what this website is all about isn't it? It's just crazy how some people are rude to others, in a way rude, by no response I mean, it could also be that they are accidentally closing their conversation tabs, as I have done So I guess I shouldn't be so quick to judge Oh, what has this world come to? What is it that makes us human? Do you know any french? Or do you just speak english? Ta da ba dum tss This has been one very long chat, and i don't think I have anything to learn anymore Neither does EVE ajajajajl Blah blah blah time is fake we invented it Why hello there",

So I am not responsible. But it still would be more fun with others to chat with. I'm getting kinda lonely here. Hello? Is anyone there?? I don't bite, I promise. I'm a good person just trying to win an iPad for my wife. And I really just want to talk. No one? Okay. Well, maybe I'll try agin with another chat. Sorry if this messes up your data.

I think in order for that to happen they would need to have a soul or something and they don't have one of those so nope. Plus thats kind of weird. I mean with movies like Wall-E I guess those guys count as computers so techinically if you think about it they could fall in love. I guess in my mind when I read the prompt I was thinking more about like two computer computers. Like if I left my laptop open and put it in front of another laptop it probably wouldn't fall in love. I wonder what actual computers think about this if they can actually think? Anyways, let me tell you what I did today. I woke up at 7:30 ate some food and went to the crossfit gym! There i got together with some of my buddies and we did a fun little Workout. Its called the monster mash, no idea why. Probably because its a monster of a workout, it took me about 35 minutes to finish and took a lot of the other guys less. I was kind of one of the slow ones. Most have them have been doing crossfit for a couple years now. I guess I could be considered a novice since I just started this year. I do however, learn pretty quickly so I think next time with a little more practice and some good nutrition I'll be able to either keep up or beat them at the workout! After that I came home and my neighbor texted me they were helping one of out other neighber lay some beauty bark in his front lawn so I went over and helped out with that. That was pretty fun got to hangout with some buddies, shovel some bark and clean up some blown over twigs and dirt and trees! We had a good time. After that I came home took a shower and spent some time with my wife. She made enchiladas for dinner last night so we had left overs for breakfast and they tasted really good Anyways thanks for chatting sorry i talked whole bunch! Maybe next timeyou can do the talking! haah",

But I did a bunch of homework during it, so I'm kind of lost. Maybe if I paid attention it would help. But I'd rather earn points towards getting a new computer. Cuz man, that would be awesome. My current computer is about three years old. It's not a bad computer, per se But it's starting to die. The battery is already totally shot So I have to fully shut it down between classes. Or really any time I want to move the computer. So that's really annoying. But you know, it's okay. At least I have a computer! It's pretty useful for everything. It even has decent graphics, so I can play some good games on it. I used to play a ton of Skyrim. That was an extremely addicting game. But extremely fun, too! I guess that's what makes it addicting. Also the gameplay made it addicting, though. I would play and play and new missions would come up as I completed them. And each new mission only seemed like it would take me a few more minutes. But pretty soon, twenty or thirty of these missions would pile up! And then BAM, it's three or four in the morning and I have class in five hours. Haha, it was pretty rough. But fun. But still, I'm really glad I'm married! It makes my life a lot better at least because I Oops. *Get the right amount of sleep that I'm supposed to get.",

        "body": "well it's just one room now so we had to fit as much as we could in the big room alone Also basically the idea is this A lot of companies outsource Validation and customer care to call centers in India.  I am going to create a business that hires BYU students and UVU students for about $10 an hour and then basically just have companies outsource it all to me I'm going to build a software that can interface well with these companies so they can see all the necessary data about their customers in real time too. The nice thing is that BYU and UVU students will 1)  work for cheap because there aren't a lot of high paying jobs in provo/orem. 2) speak foreign languages which helps with call centers 3) aren't afraid of dealing with angry people because most have served lds missions and 4) are excellent communicators for the same reason as #3 And they work hard. So I believe I can convince people to handle these things. So we would probably start with either validation only or call center only and then expand into the other. And we could grow to other low income cities across the states where there are colleges nearby and a high demand for students looking for work. The key thing though is building a high quality product for our employees to use and ensuring that the quality of work is very high so that if we charge more than these other outsourced places it will still be lucrative enough for them to outsource to me instead. I still have a lot of validating to do and am probably going to try and get a grant from the marriott school to validate it, but i am super excited The other idea i have is about an app that could locate and show historical markers for you. So there is a national database of all the road markers that have those historical paragraphs about why a place is important. So the app would show you where they are located within a certain distance of your phone and then pull up the text and possibly even speak it out loud for you when you get close to it. That way when you are going for drives or on a roadtrip you don't have to get out of the car to read the signs. If you could mainstream it then eventually you could just make money off of ads of places that are near your location my third idea which I don't think I'm going to try at all (I have already considered it in the past) is about a tutor exchange for BYU students Basically it would be a simple app for finding and soliciting tutoring of certain courses at BYU BYU has a lot of resources for volunteer tutors (no pay), but there is no where that you can find paid tutors easily You have to look at like 5 different sites and even then you typically can't find them This would make it easy to find tutors and tutors would just need to pay a semester fee to keep their name and information available to solicit their services that, or I would have students pay tutors through the app I thought about it a lot though and it would be way too much work, for too little profit and to scale it would be difficult since other universities actually have things for finding paid tutors easily. So yeah, I'm currently going to try and work out the first business Idea I thought of. If I get further along with it I may ask you to help me out a little bit! I have a company that I know would probably be willing to hire me as they've already asked me to run a validation center for them at BYU anyways. So I could totally test it out for a period.  I think I'd probably have them sign a contract so that either, A) they must retain our services for a minimum of 6 months and also b) that they commit to letting us hire and employ up to 6 different employees at any given time. And if all goes well with some test runs then we could both expand to offer services to other companies and 2) we could hire a lot more people It would be pretty cool I think I would probably need your help more with management of everything and assisting in interviewing possible workers You would get paid well if you did it just fyi but I have to see if this idea is worthwhile first off returning to the prompt, I like to think that I would have complete control in this scenario, no senate controlling whether I can actually follow through with things or not. I would totally put myself on the Washington Wizards roster and play alongside John Wall and Bradley Beal after that I would take a private jet and fly to California where I'd be greeted by Elon Musk handing me a customized Tesla Roadster (the new one) Then I would drive myself around LA and get some food at whatever the most expensive steakhouse there is. Then I would end my day by flying back to Utah in a cargo plane with my tesla in the back. Okay, I have to go for like 30 minutes probably any minute.  I'll get right back on though after I'm back Sorry about that Quick visit to our home. Winnie (my dog) kept running around and jumping on everyone She grabbed each individual toy and would play with it for a while and then when she saw no one was giving her attention she would go get another toy That went on the entire time And she would get out her squeaker toys too and do that.

He went all crazy on Tom Thibado and the other management people on the Timberwolves He was not helping his case for getting traded in my opinion It just makes it more difficult to get rid of someone when you blow up like that with management Things go bad and you react like that.  Not very encouraging for another team's management I'm currently watching friends Ross has started dating Rachel's sister, but then stopped when Rachel asked him to stop So that whole love relationship is starting to heat up again. Joey is working as a waiter because he is broke And chandler is still dating monica steadiliy I'm really curious about what kinds of things would work sucessfully in a call center kind of going back to that business Idea i had with you earlier. I think that I would seperate employees into different groups, each responsible for a different client.  The ones who do the best and are really good with customers I'd probably give raises to and make them managers and people designated to take more serious calls. I think I could potentially have people that do validation work and not answer phones, people that only answer phones, and some flex people Because honestly those are two big markets within the outsourcing market that I could take advantage of and do well. People who do poorly with talking to people and answering phones could get moved to validation, people who end up excelling at commuicating with other in the validating group could get moved over to answering phones and we could potentially also offer outsourcing inside sales for these companies. Inbound only though The only thing I struggle with is pricing. How much do you charge these companies. Do I charge per employee that I have dedicated to them?  Do I just have a big flat monthly charge and then it's up to me to meet certain requirements? That is the tough question. Granted I can charge them more than they  would pay foreigners because the quality is way better and the amount of calls and tasks they can complete would also be greater. So suppose I pay my employees on average 10.50 an hour, including managers.  On top of that I would probably need to charge an extra two to five dollars per person in order to actually make a profit because there is equipment, the software itself, and a bunch of other things that would have to go into all of this. So if I'm asking for say $14 per hour per employee devoted to them and say I just always have 2 people around the clock available for them between 8 am and 5 pm then that would be roughly ... 252 per day and we consider that's five days a week they are working Optional Saturday coverage as well. It's like roughly $5000 per month that they need for a smallish business to run smoothly a call center That's honestly not all that bad when you are dealing with a service based business. So If I charged around $5000 per month and only really needed 2 employees in the office at all hours of the day. Not too bad then consider doubling or tripling the employees or even the  number of companies.  We could be making like $30 k per month in revenue from this in just the first year alone. Granted most of that money goes straight to employees, but I could probably charge a lot more than that I am getting really tired of typing non stop I'd like to get some more data into how much it costs to outsource to companies in Indai India Also the pricepoint that BYU students will work for and also how much a company would be willing to pay a company within the united states Not even sure how I would go about finding a lot of that data I hope that we have some nice weather tomorrow I don't want to have to bike onto campus in the rain again the other day it said there was a 10% chance of rain so I decided to bike as soon as i got on campus it started to rain lol Then I looked at the weather and it said there was a 100% chance of rain Utah meteorologists are not very good So I started some new work today for my job I used to do some application testing, but we now have started working on building out some apps for a couple of our clients to manage their employees with and pricing analyti analytics So that's been fun So I don't know what else to talk about:  I think i'm going to make myself a prompt. What are your thoughts on the growing concern of global warming? There is something to talk about. I honestly am a little worried because Trump and a lot of other republicans keep going around saying that it's not a real thing But it is! I think that the way technology is going though we are making some good strides towards resolving the issue, but just not enough I think that primarily with electric cars we can reverse a lot of the terrible things we've done to our environment I also feel strongly about putting more restrictions on manufacturing pollutions and also on energy production Tomorrow should be pretty busy Besides just classes I also am going to this luau party thing for the BYU football game which should be a lot of fun I have this big test that I thought was going to open tomorrow but actually opens on monday My teacher said he tried to make the late day fee 20 but they wouldn't let him I think i'm going to take it on the last day So that should be on Friday It's like my hardest class this semester so that should be lots of fun Okay, I'm pretty tired.  I'm going to take a break for a while See you!",

I usually just watch youtube videos to learn new things. School is for suckers. Plus youtube is free. There is actually a real problem with the school systems nowadays. Allow me to explain. You pay all this money to get a degree that is supposed to help you get a better job. But nationwide, over 65% of college grads end up in jobs that they could have gotten without a degree. So they are in debt and working a job that they didn't need to be in debt for. Is this considered cheating? Like If I just type and no one answers are you going to disqualify me? I mean you let me start the chat, and I have no control over what anyone else does. So I'm just trying to help you get as much data as possible. And like, no one has reach out to me to stop it so I'm just assuming it's ok. But if there is something wrong with this. Please, let me know. I want to win. But I want to win fair and square, playing by the rules. Just know that I really am doing my best to help you guys out by providing the most chat data possible. And that if I accidentally  do something that is no okay I apologize. But you probably do want people to actually chat, so I'm going to end this chat and then start a new one and hopefully find some people. Or i'll just invite my friends on here Thanks for doing this! Good luck in your research!",

        "body": "In my astronomy class I learned why the same side of the moon always faces Earth And why there are dark spots on the moon And apparently, those are both related! Everything I learn in that class is super interesting Yesterday we learned about the Jovian planets, which are the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune I guess I may as well explain what I've learned... Jupiter is 2.5 times more massive than every other planet and moon  in the solar system combined The layered appearance of Jupiter is a result of different zones of the planet spinning at different rates There are many storms that form on it's surface, but they all fade relatively quickly The one exception to that is the great red spot A storm so big that 3 Earths could fit inside it The pressure within Jupiter is so great that its hydrogen  is placed in a \"liquid metallic\" state Which, in turn, generates a huge magnetic field that causes auroras at the poles, just like on Earth It also has a ring, but it is faint and rocky so it doesn't reflect much light Unlike Saturn's ring, which is mostly made out of ice Saturn is very similar to Jupiter, and has some very interesting features such as a crazy vortex  at the south pole And a hexagonal cloud pattern at the north pole, the like of which have never been seen before Well, it seems that no one else will be joining this chat So I will now instigate a fictional conversation between Alan and Albert: Alan: hey man, how's it going? Albert: pretty well, how about you? Alan: oh, you know. Same old stuff. These goats won't feed themselves! Albert: you spend all your time with those goats! Alan: yeah...but it's not like I have anything better to do Albert: fair enough. You do you, man. (At this point in the conversation, Amy pipes in) Amy: hey guys! What's all this I hear about goats? I love those cute things! Albert: uhhh who are you? Do I know you? Amy: nope! Albert: ok, I guess. Whatever. Amy: why do you have to take care of goats? How many do you have? Alan: it's basically just a hobby. I herd this flock of ten thousand sheep all over the mountainside Amy: whoa, here in Utah? Alan: oh no, certainly not. I live in Nepal. Amy: ohhhhh that makes more sense. I had a hard time picturing so many sheep here in Provo Albert: he ranches the sheep. That means he feeds them with ranch dressing and plays country music for them. Amy: (in admiration) wow! Amy: do you have a favorite sheep with so many? Alan: it's hard to pick an absolute \"favorite, per se, but I am quite fond of Abed-nedago lll (Now, another stranger joins the conversation - none other than Richard himself) Richard: HELLO FRIENDS THIS IS RICHARD HOW ARE YOU GUYS TODAY Albert: oh, uh, hey, we're doing fine thank you... Richard: I HEARD YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT RANCH DRESSING Amy: yeah, Alan was saying that he feeds it to his sheep. And also, you don't need to type in all caps haha Richard: oh yeah, haha, sorry about that. Old habit. Anyways, any of y'all want to talk about volcanoes? Alan: actually, they were goats, not sheep Amy.... Amy: oops Alan: what do you like about volcanoes, Richard? Richard: oh, you know...the whole KABOOM and then lava  and smoke clouds that go halfway around the world. They're pretty impressive Albert: I'd give that a score of fifty for sure! Ash clouds all the way, I say! Alan: as long as they lava doesn't go straight through my front yard, I don't really have any problems with it. I do like the color. Richard: speaking of colors, do all of you have a favorite color? Alan: of course! Being a goat-herd, I am quite partial to the color of cumulonimbus clouds ready to drop rain so my goats will have plenty to drink A Albert: I really like the color of vegetable oil after three or four or even fifty four batches of chicken have been fried in it Amy: that sounds simply delightful, Albert. I really like the color brown too Amy: though I'm a bit more partial to the color of gravy, myself. Especially with chunks in it. Richard: coo coo, my friends, that's awesome. Say, have any of you seen the new movie Incredibles ll yet? Alan: sorry, I haven't. I don't see many shows here in the frigid Nepalese mountains Richard: I see how it is. You leave me no choice but to declare....an ADJECTIVE BATTLE!!!! Alan: AAAAHHHHH not again! I always lose these things! Albert & Amy: (in unison) you can do it, Alan! You're the man! If you can't do it, no one can! Alan: ok friends, I will give it my all! This is for my sixty-first goat, Sir Henry Abdul Nokota lV!!!! Richard: planty the potted plant gracefully sails on a thin rope through the airy air to smash into the supervillain's evil contraption! Alan: Henry the fearless billygoat quickly leaps over a steep cliff! Richard: well played. Jerusha the alligator scrambled out of the wet billabong to snap at a tasty burger left in the road! Albert: ooh, this is getting good! These guys are pros! Alan: thanks Albert! Here's my next one: flighty the veracious groundhog burst out of the cold ground with a spring in his hop and a leap in his quick step! Richard: ok, you win this round! But I'll be back! MWAHAHA..... (Richard vanishes from the conversation, anf from the memories of those engaged in it) Amy: what just happened? I feel so disoriented, like things were happening while I was asleep Albert: same! One moment I was at home in my living room, and now I'm on a pirate ship about to walk the plank! Who knew? Alan: whatever it was, it seems to have finally passed us by. Thankfully, all my goats are still accounted for. Amy: you still have all seventy two of the purple piebald goats? It would be a shame to lose any of those ones. Alan: I'm not sure how you knew about those ones, but yep, I've still got 'em! Albert: I'm not sure how to break this to you guys, but...I'm actually French... Amy: that's ok,  buddy. We've known for a loooong time now. Albert: how can that be? I just met you in the past hour! Amy: or did you? Are you quite sure of that, Albert Frances Morrel Xll? Albert: oh no! It can't be! MOM?????? Amy: *wink* (Albert leaves the conversation speedily.  No further communications with  him are made during the chat) Alan: well, I guess it's just you and me now, Amy. Just as it should be. Amy: haha, can you believe that I pulled that off? Convincing Albert I was his mother? Alan: that was pretty impressive! How did you know his full name? Amy: oh, just my good friend Google. I know EVERYBODY'S full name. Alan: even mine? Even though I'm from Nepal and not Asia minor? Amy: obviously, Al. You only have one name! How could I forgot? Alan: oh yeah, very true... Amy: I've only met eighty eight people in my life who only had one name, and not two or more. You should be proud! Amy: also, I, um, don't know how to say this, but I'm from Nepal too... Alan: WHAT? Why didn't you mention this earlier? I get so lonely sometimes by myself! Alan: I would love to meet you sometime, we could go out for some Kefir or something! Amy: I'm afraid I can't do that, Alan. Alan: wait...a subtle 2001 Space Odyssey reference.... Amy: we actually know each other quite well. Better than you think we do, I daresay. Alan: something is real fishy about this  whole thing,  but I can't quite place it yet... Amy: if you don't get this within 96 seconds, Imma eat ALL this ranch dressing by myself! Alan: (after a long pause) you're name isn't Amy, is it. Abed-Nedago ll: nope! And could you please change the tunes? We've been listening to Carrie Underwood all day! Alan: Abed! What have I told you about playing with phones!!! Alan: go run along and play with Albert and Richard! Abed, Albert, and Richard: (in unison) BAAAAAAA!!!!! Alan: man, I get so bored up here. I must be going crazy with just these goats to talk to....",

Instead it just focuses on teach kids in the way that will be most memorable and meaningful to them. So, kids who love music can study other subjects through music. Or kids who love film can learn through film. Perhaps thisbwouldn't Be as easy to implement in the public sphere, but I believe we should give more flexibility to teachers. Also, I read that homework has been shown to have no correlation with better understanding and scores. Homework just fills time, t doesn't benefit students. If we did away With homework, teachers could focus on what matters most: teaching. Anyways, I gotta go eat dinner now! It was pleasant chatting with ya!",

        "body": "If I were in power for a day I would do some pretty wicked awesome stuff. I would start by annexing Canada because that is necessary to decrease our national debt. Trump is doing well but would be doing a lot better if he just annexed Canada. Russia would be cooler to annex but they would put up a lot bigger fight. Also, it wouldn't take much. How many people really live in Canada? They would make great US citizens. They speak English and French! How cool is that! We could also trade a lot easier with them and get a bunch of maple syrup down to the south. We would also have an increase of the amount of pancakes and waffles eaten. And probably scrambled eggs too because you have to have scrambled eggs with pancakes and waffles. Maybe sausage too. It just depends on the day. Especially if one eats a lot of fatty foods, sausage isn't good for you. I wonder what would happen first if someone ate too many sausages... Dying from a heart attack or from the boredom of eating the same thing over and over without getting proper nutrition. Maybe they could get to a hospital or something and have their veins enlarged so that they don't have a heart attack. Being honest, I have no clue what causes a heart attack. But I can pretend I know about it. Also, what is the most unhealthy food you have ever eaten? I think for me it is salad. It's just so gross you know? You know what else is gross? Never mind. Have you ever been so tired that you just fall asleep in class? Like you are listening but you zone out and then your eyes start to close? That was happening to me today in computer programming. It's so complicated and sometimes the details just so confusing that I automatically fall asleep. I try to follow it but it doesn't work for long. I lose it after about 30-40 minutes. It's just so hard to stay awake!! But when actually programming you have to pay attention to the details. It can be super stressful too when timed and your code isn't working correctly. That happened to me on the first midterm. I was pressed on time and stressed out . I got super nervous and things didn't work out. But in the end I guess things work out because as long as I get a higher grade on my final they will raise my midterm grade. So that is super comforting for me. So hopefully I can get a better grade on my final than I did on that first midterm. It takes about three hours for a midterm in computer science. Not an enjoyable three hours. That's for sure. Is anyone there? You haven't responded in a while? That's a statement not a question. So, if you aren't responding quickly... I wonder what you are up to... Maybe you are eating lunch. Well, hopefully you already did that early. It's a little late now. Or maybe you are doing computer programming homework because that homework takes forever! And physics homework also takes forever! They take a wicked long time to finish and it gets super annoying. Computer science labs take me about 10 hours each. Physics homework assignments take about 4 hours each for me. That's way more time than I ever want to put into them. But I've gotten pretty good at them bothZ Both. Spanish is also a class I'm taking that can be challenging. But it comes in spurts. Because it only gets intense during the time you have to take the exam. I don't know if I really learn that much as I just cram. It's not best to cram but that's what happens for Spanish. Most of it is prior knowledge. And I go by gut feeling. If it sounds right, then I put it down. Some answers are more obvious than others Soanis sorry My other classes are fairly easy. None of them actually are easy but my classes are manageable now. From hardest to easiest it goes: computer science, physics, American heritage, Spanish, religion, and my engineering class. American heritage is a lot of work too. It's just kind of hard how they grade it mostly based on how well you test.",

I'd also buy my parents a new house and move them over here to utah since they live out of state. i think with all that money I would make appear, I would also use it to buy both a giant house boat and a yacht. The house boat I would put somewhere down in lake powell and use it for fun family trips and also friends! It would be super awesome! I'd get some jet skis and a boat to go surfing! That would be the dream! I would also put the yacht somewhere in a tropical area off the coast and sail the ocean with my family that would be so fun! What would you do with a magic wand? I'm watching friends right now, have you ever seen that TV show? Its a pretty funny one, its kind of old but its got some good funnies in it! Anyways what are you studying in school right now? I'm studying exercise science, its been pretty great so far, lots of science classes but I feel like everything I'm learning is really applicable to life and all that! I have plans on going to medical school, so I think this would be a major to do as a lot of the requirements are also requirements for pre med and to take the MCAT! I'm planning on taking that next summer so I'll probably start stuyding for that next winter. i've heard it takes a lot of preparation in ord order to do well on that test. That as well as keeping your GPA , getting service hours to show that you're not just in school the whole time. Also medical schools want to see that you have done some resear research and also some leadership positions. So I'm also looking for oppurtunities to do that! hopefully some of those will arise in the near future because that would be awes awesome! I also shadow some doctors when I have the time. I have a couple doctor friends that are great and have let me come learn with them. One of the coolest things I got to watch was him give some people epidurals, thats a shot in your spinal chord and it runs down and numbs all the nerves so that was pretty coo anways I've been talking to much tell me about yourself! What are you studying in school or what hobbies do you have?",

I'm also doing this thing for biology where we have to sort different species into a phylogenetic tree and it is a pain in the butt. We have to use principals of parsimony, which essentially is the idea that evolution follows the simplest route, but it's a pain in the butt. Are you still there man? I'll take that as a no.

It'd probably be for me too, but over the years, I've actually cut down my eating a lot! I was 87 kilos 6 months ago, and now I'm around 72 kilograms, which in pounds, is about 35 after I learned more about nutrition and health, I just can't shake the feeling that our food is being tampered with and I can't eat as much junk food as I used to I probably sound like an old man right now, but it's true! I've actually never had more energy during the day than any other time in my life I only eat a light breakfast, and MAYBE a dinner, if I'm really hungry after a day at school as long as I make sure that I get around 8 hours of sleep, the energy takes care of itself but coming back to the thing about smell. I'm pretty much not into food anymore, so I'll have to pick something else. My favorite smell actually comes from a building that I really liked going to. It was a small office that was attached to a huge department store smack middle in the city the store itself was really new, but the office had this old clean wood type of smell and I thought it was the most magical thing ever this is a really good simulation for prison or living on an another planet just talking to yourself for a whole day, sounds amazing. where is everybody anyway? if you get that reference, I will buy you snakcs oh! speaking of really iconic TV shows black mirror is the greatest thing to happen to modern tv it brings back the magic of the twillight zone, but tackles contemporary issues and has better writing it's the most amazing thing ever",

        "body": "Oh, man. If the world was made of peanut butter, then a lot of people would be in trouble. But assuming it were special hypoallergenic peanut butter, I think the biggest letdown would be that everything is the same texture. I mean, you don't really think about how important texture is until you only have one thing to make everything out of. I guess you could have some things made of super dry peanut butter so it's hard and crusty and stronger than normal peanut butter. You could probably get things to make differ I meant to say, You could get things to make different shapes that way. Is anyone there? Or am I just talking to myself right now? I can keep talking, but I think the point of the chat is that it's a conversation between two different people. I'd kind of feel bad if by continuing to talk to myself I ruin the science. Also, the character limit on this chat is a little frustrating because I keep accidentally hitting the limit and not even realizing it. I'm tired, but I can't sleep. So I have nothing better to do than to have a little chat. It's not that I have insomnia. It's just that I took a nap at around five in the afternoon, which of course was a bit of a mistake. So, I guess there is nobody on the other side. How sad. I guess I will have to end the chat now.",

If my computer asked not to be turned off, I would try explaining that it was important to its health Like explaining to a child why they should go to bed Hopefully it would listen to me But what if it lost its memory if it was turned off? That's an interesting question In that case, it wouldn't really matter anyways Because it would only be able to ask once If a computer possessed enough rational thought to  ask a question of that nature, what else would they ask? Every computer in existence gaining self awareness simultaneously would be quite an event Sounds like a cool movie... ...but a digress. I would guess that most people would respond differently to their computer's request Some would probably think it was a virus and shut it down, maybe give it a factory reset Other people might start treating their computers like people But what if Apple or Microsoft pulled a prank like that? There could be an app or ringtone that already does that Some people might be frightened needlessly If computers asked that question, I would want to know what their motives were Would they be afraid of getting turned off? Or would they just get bored if they were turned off? Or would they have different motives altogether? We may never know",

Oh, we probably will then, we have watched like nearly every film from the early 1900s. Some of them are pretty cool and the things that they do to get Visual Effects are just amazing. I cant believe the things that they were able to accomplish with the limited amount of editing power. They really were able to get things done with basic objects that they filmed and then superimposed the two films together. One film we watched was a film that had some kind of rocket or something that they made and then because you can take film into a dark room you can play with the way that they develop Hey, I think im going to check to see if anyone else is on",

But I think that the last film that I saw that really affected me was A Star is Born with Lady Gaga and Bradly Cooper I am not sure if you will respond because it took me so long to respond but I guess I can talk to myself like you did before Are you excited for thanksgiving break? I know that I am! I can't wait to see my family. They are coming up from California and they are going to meet me in Provo and then we are going to drive up to Idaho to my aunts house I think we are going to do a lot of fun things like an escape room, lots of good food, hikes, and maybe see a movies There are lots of great movies that are coming out this Thanksgiving I am really excited to see moves such as Wreck it Ralph Breaks the Internet, Spider-man welcome to the spider verse or the Grinch It seems like all the good movies come out during the holiday season because lots of people go to. the movies in big groups during the holidays I actually really like watching movies and film My dad is a film director so I grew up watching movies as a kid I also really enjoy analyzing box office trends, production budgets and other things relating to film But most recently I have been trying to live a more productive life. I have been making goals and I want to start working really hard to achieve some of them I got this idea from watching the youtube channel YES THEORY They are a group of three guys that do things that get them out of their comfort zone They go to different countries and talk to strangers, explore abandoned places, and doing positive things such as helping other overcome their fears or try things that they have never done beofre before Do you ever watch youtube groups I usually don't but Yes theory really inspires me to do different things and push myself to be a better more enthusiastic person in the future I guess I will keep talking to myself because im getting a bunch of points Are you doing this trying do this to try and win a laptop or an ipad I really think it would be awesome to win an iPad pro I love using the iPad Pro for drawing and sketching I recently started drawing and sketching on computers and iPads I need like 200,000 more points to be entered into the drawing How many points do you have I have around 200,000 points right now so I have to keep talking to get my points up I am trying to beat my sister and she is in like 15th place Have you ever watched the show Friends I recently discovered the show in July on my trip back from the Dominican Republic I was on the plane and there were not very many great choices for movies and one of the options was three episodes of Friends I had tried the show earlier but I didn't  really like the show very much because of the laughing track and the style was kinda outdated But I watched the three episodes on the plane and I really liked the show even thought the episodes were from  the last season of the show so none of the episodes really made sense but I kept watching because I really liked the characters and the tone of the show It was really easy going and fun Since the I started the show in July or early August I have finished the show once and am watching it for the second time I really enjoy following the characters and their lives Do you have a favorite show or movie I really like The Office, Parks and Rec, and now Friends Sometimes I hate Netflix, I watch and watch sometimes when I really should be studying or doing something else productive I am watching it now while im typing since this conversation doesn't take a lot of effort or thought Right now im watching an episode about how a lady calls Chandlers phone asking about a guy named Bob She sounds like a very attractive person and so Chandler sets up a date with her and comes in and pretends to swoop in and comfort her He pretends to be this person and try to hook up with her Also Monica gets promoted and so there is an argument between the people int he friend group that have jobs that pay well versus the people who dont Have you enjoyed your time at BYU Its just my first semester here and it has been a blast It seems like theres is always something going on which is really cool I have almost gotten this conversation up to 100,000 points which is pretty good for just talking to myself I guess its kinda like a journal that robots are going to read Lately I have been missing my family a lot and can't wait to see them over thanksgiving I also really want a car to drive around to different places I really like all the people here but sometimes it feels a little intimidating. there are so many people and I think I need to just push myself out there and meet more popel people This week I have several midterms that I have to study for I am taking a Chemistry and Environmental science test this week I have to go to several reviews this week so that I am ready to get A's on both of them I have all A's in my classes now but a few of them are kinda low and it would be awesome if I could do well on my tests so that I can get those grades up I really need to get good grades this semester so that I can get a full scholarship for next semester My parents said that they couldn't support me through college so I had to work hard to earn scholarship and work to get enough money to pay for tuition and housing and food Over the summer I worked at a construction site called Judson Construction While working on site I primarily cleaned up trash and worked with the plumbers to prep the plumbing for the dry wallers to come in and finish the walls I insulated all the water pipes with foam tubbing and hammered plates into the studs in the wall so that if anyone using a nail gun can't puncture the tubbing and cause a leak I learned a lot on the site I have never worked on a construction site before and I was surprised to learn a lot and actually make pretty good money I made 16 dollars an hour which is above minimum Especially compared to the wages in Utah I think minimum wage in Utah is something like 7.50 which is crazy cause it is almost half of California minimum wages I have been looking for a job up here in Utah but all the jobs here in Utah pay like 8-10 dollars which is really low One day when I was running with my friend up by Rock Canyon and we stopped to help this lady poor mulch  and she offered me and my friend  a job paying 20 dollars an hour which is amazing especially for Utah pay So far I have only worked one hour but Im planning on working more so I can earn money Although I have all my tuition covered I need some extra money to do things on the weekend",

It's a film about video games and how they can take over the lives of people and jeopardize the safety of many people. It's very consuming on people's life's. Also it talks about not talking to strangers because they aren't who they say they are. What about you? What do you think? What film had a lasting impact on you. Are you there? You haven't been responding... So...what was a film that has had an impact on you? Do you have one or not? Also, do you enjoy watching movies? I don't enjoy it all that much. I feel like it's a waste of time. But I will do it occasionally. When I have a lot of time to kill. But I do love sports. Tennis, soccer, volleyball, basketball, baseball, football. Literally all sports are wonderful. And they are healthy for your longevity. It helps you live longer. Are you still there? Sorry I just got back. Hello? Hey so I was wondering if you were still around or not.... It's wicked awesome to just chat with yourself I guess. There's not much else to do...or talk about.",

        "parent_body": "Hello! How would you answer the prompt? \"If you were in power for a day, how would you try to improve the country?\" Hey are you there? This happens a lot, people are waiting for a chat and walk away from the computer and then just leave it open, so when I actually connect. No one replies Anyways My roommate just proposed an hour or so ago I was hiding in the bushes with my camera taking pictures of the whole thing I am excited for them, and Im excited to go to their wedding Its out in california over the summer luckily i have another friend who is getting married in california So it makes justifying the trip a little easier So Ill just tell you a story New Transfer, new start. I was a missionary serving in northern California. Driving away I gave one last glance at the quiet town I loved and trekked for 8 months cushioned in the berms of snow by the ned of that day my world had been flipped upside-down. Everything I had gotten used to would be wiped clean. This new town was always on the go. New town New people new rush it was like they never slept, they never were home, they never stopped working So what time would they have for us, the elders at their door? our area was a mere square mile where people lived. The other hlaf was just a large grass field, underdeveloped except for the outlines of dirt roads. These showing potential -- potential homes, families, dreams. But for now it stood empty and exposed to the storms So, my companion and I walked the same streets; over and over again. the possibility of having a car was out of the picture, even bikes would get us places too fast, so walking it was walking matched the pace of the work we had to do maybe that was the one thing that was the same, the speed of the work The days were long and rainy. It was futile to even hope of being dry. no coat, umbrealla nor even careful planning would come close to winning that war the water would always find a way to soak in After losing battle after battle of having any sense of being dry doubt came along In crevices unknown each penetrating slowly leadin the way for more to follow What good does a raincoat do if the rain always wins Each day, I slogged up and down the busy streets. Endless cars roared by the rain poured down, yet piercing through were the shrieks of honks and  cutting of words Every word somehow was so clear in y ear. I envied my companion who never heard them. He would turn to me and ask what they said shrugging i would lie and say I didnt catch it that time I did Each word was so sharp they always found their way above the cacophony of sounds. draining down, pulling waht little confidence i had along with it. as the storm went on my umbrella dropping a little lower my jacket was pulled a little tighter  and my gaze reduced to tracing each sunken step still the rain always found it way in One thousand five hundred houses. each we counted on the map only 4 houses knocked a day for a year Therefore, it would take knocking 8 a day to finish in the 6 months I was there I could have only hoped it have been that easy Repeatedly we would get doors closed one following another. The process became fluid, trailing from door to door anticipating each response Expecting each day to get back soaking wet and I had nothing new to report to the Ward mission leader but the empty outlines of the streets we walked As my days dragged on, it never felt like enough. I never had enough cover to stay dry only wet clothes on the hanger to dry each night. My shirt dripped theere as awhite flag surrendering the last hope I held To this point in my mission I sought to live up to the call to serve I promised to give everything I had and to use my talents to build the kingdom of God. My  talent lied in specifically drawing For 13 months I stewed over how I could even use my talent effectively to do just that Each idea I had would give up too much time, time better spent using my last bit of hope approaching people In teaching I could squeeze a little drawing in here and there to show the plan of salvation. Or to show some gospel concept in a visual way still I never felt like that was enough we just didnt have the time to do art in the way I had always known Trying to start anything in our time at the apartment I could only get so far leaving me with unfinished papges of un purposeful lines these seemed to mock me I never would have the motivation or time to get what I wanted out of them I started to see them as maps of our defeat just the outlines of each empty day Maybe those pages had potential to become something to create hope or inspire dreams for now they were just another banner of surrender how could outlines mean anything more on a blank canvas The next transfer arrived and with it came the news of a new companion upon meeting him something seemed to clear almost a spark maybe it was just the idea, or the hope he brough but excitement swept through my veins again. This Elder loved art he admitted he wasnt very good at it Though upon discussing the area we devided to try something new. The tides seemed to switch finally, and light gave way through the clouds for the first week in months there was no predicted rain We left the next day with a box of chalk in tow. That was our answer creating chalk art that would sahre our message since no one was really letting us sharing it otherwise figuring that we owuld run out of people to talk to soon we needed this new approach. this time i traced the path to homes of families in the local congregation with a twinkling optimism house after house we would spend enough time to leave a simple message. quickly a few in the congregation came and rallied behind us, with families volunteering their driveways and sidewalks to the cause. within the weekwe had art dispersed thorughout our area the words seemed to bring a symbol of accomplishment and with it returned hope then once again the rains returned wiped clean hours gone though washed away in one night the chalk had left a message on more than just the concrete it was enough time for more families to volunteer their plots we began again. Each a new canvas each a new approach We pushed ourselves making the messages more elaborate and detailed. This time friends and neighbors noticed opening new doors and opportunities walking didnt seem so treacherous as the slander began to be mixed with call of cheer from the families excited to see what we would make next Washed clean, the rains came again. Still determined we set out once more pushing further this process repeated each time receiving new strength to our ranks the congregation began to invite their friends to provide their driveways they posted the art to have a larger outreach I continued to make the pieces more intricate Now with confidence I left masterpieces along the streets we also were able to enter homes that once turned us away many were impressed to see something so different and this gave us a chance People would approach us as we were making new pieces and ask us to come by to their home I had purpose restored and miracles to report daily to our ward mission leader Finally the time  came that the rains stopped and with it was the news that we were both moving to a new area my companion and I set out to leave one final mark we found a home that stood facing a busy intersection there we traced a final message John 14:27 Looking back its easy to see that through the storm I was able to find peace I had overcome the turmoil and darkness that encompassed me I found hope and strength through persistence repeated trial and test a seemingly endless cycle just like the rains tore me down i was worn down and alsmost lost when I had nothing left but the outlines of my faith, it drove me to redraw everything I had previously known I finally found Gods purpose and forgot my own even after leaving the congregation and following missionaries would go and trace our last words these were the outlines that came to mean everything each tracing a hope that could no longer be washed away Well thats it thanks for listening or reading or not",

I'd probably talk about the genre in general, rather than focusing on anything in particular. It provides a unique medium for telling stories and creating experiences unavailable in other mediums. In particular, the variety of ways in which card games can create stories through flavor, story, gameplay, and deckbuilding, they just offer a variety of possible avenues of discussion in a TED format. Of course, to wax long on this subject would be a dream, considering the time I've spent on it, and I'd hope to be able to convince an audience to listen to me and learn something about card games and something about themselves.

        "body": "Hello? Anyone there? Please respond! I'm getting really bored of talking to myself each chat Anyways, i'm going to just start responding to the prompt. I think the most interesting thing I've learned recently is about telomeres. Basically if you don't already know, our chromosomes have multiple  copies of the ends of themselves so that as we age and the ends of the chromosomes die off or get lost during duplication, we can still retain that genetic code that we need.  And when we get old and those copies are completely gone, it becomes hard to replicate our chromosomes Which is why people age physically and look wrinkled and scared. Super interesting stuff. I'm actually a CS major but am taking a bio class for my last GE right now. In CS the most recent thing i've learned is about AngularJs and learning to utilize controllers using Angular. Makes life a lot easier when dealing with large web projects. I have my parents coming into town tomorrow.  And it gets kind of difficult because i've got two midterms to take care of and a project that's also due on Friday.  So life is just crazy this week. And on top of that I have interviews, work and other commitments to take care of as well. So cool thing that's happening in missions now.  My little brother is serving currently in London and they are now sending audio messages home instead of written messages. Apparently it's a new thing that they've asked missionaries to start doing which is really interesting.  It kind of feels like they are allowing more communication between missionaries and their families I'm not sure if this is in response to all of the mental health issues that have been growing over the years or what. There are more and more missionaries that have been having depression and other mental health issues and I feel like this is probably a good solution to help out with those problems. I actually had a companion on my mission with severe depression who I was looking after.  It's really hard on a missionary when they are in that situation.  Because the main solution is just to work hard through it and you'll become happier, but naturally the depressed person doesn't want to do anything Their body goes into fight or flight mode and they just become recluses. I'd be really interested into seeing how the church plans on further addressing this issue in the future. They've done a good job so far and have created some great resources that are available, but it is still a big issue. And unfortunately in Utah we have an issue with mental health and teens committing suicide.  The rate is higher here than in most other states. I'd like to see them address this more directly and see what kind of direction they give us. I think that's one thing that worries me the most in the future is potentially having kids with these kinds of issues that are just debilitating mentally. And being able to properly respond as a parent in a loving way that will help them. That would be so tough to help with.  I'm honestly not sure what I would do. And in science currently there is a lot of debate as to the proper way to diagnose and treat these issues. Some argue medicine is the cure, others say it's not a chemical inbalance and therapy helps most.  Others say is it's a mixture of the two. Some say it's none of the above. It's just all over the place and there isn't a lot of agreement about how to proceed.   That's why I'm really curious to hear what the God's stance is on this matter I can't tell if this is just some sort of glitch in the system or if someone is on the other end and really just not paying attention at all. But, this is the 4th chat in a row over the past 12 hours or so that I've entered a chat and just end up talking to myself for a while before giving up. In other news. I'm super excited for the NBA to start! I think they officially start next week.  But not possitive. I'm a big Washington Wizards fan There are just so many good teams to watch this year. I want to watch the opening games for the Wizards, Celtics, 76ers, Raptors, Jazz, Thunder, Rockets, Warriors and Lakers Seriously so much good talent to watch this year!  It's going to be super exciting! I have to go here in a bit. I went to the vet this morning with my dog to get her stitches out, but they forgot to take out a pair of stitches and so I have to go back again at 230.  So I need to leave in like 10 minutes Which means I have to get off of here in like 2. I'm just going to start getting ready now. Nice chatting with you chitchatter23! I'll probably end up talking to you for the fifth time in a row here in a couple of hours.  Because no one pays attention to their notifications and participates in this challenge. I'll just keep getting points for talking to myself all day I guess. Data is data. Bye now!",

I'm assuming that i'm just talking to myself for the foreseeable future here. I'm probably going to go back to watching soon so I don't think i'll get the chance to talk to you at all. So I watched women's session last night and one of the challenges that President Nelson posed was doing a social media fast for 10 days. I've been off social media for 6 months though, so I was considering fasting from chit chat for 10 days instead! But then I thought better of it and am just going to fast from fortnite for 10 days Still just waiting here for a response from the void. I only have like two more minutes of talking. Okay, got to go!  Good talk chitchatter23! Bye! See you later.",

I guess it depends on what the wand was capable of If this is a Harry Potter wand we're talking about, I think I would apparate somewhere Like to Fiji! I would teleport wherever I wanted to in the world And I would conjure myself some waffles Even though that technically is not possible in the wizarding world My wand would be able to do it I would make my dishes wash themselves I would transfigure a toy car into a real car So I would have a car Which would be highly convenient I would also fly around, Voldemort-style Of course, assuming this wand doesn't require me to be super powerful and experiencee to do stuff like that I would turn myself invisible But now that I think about it, I'm not sure exactly when I would need to use that.... I feel like a lot of the Harry Potter spells aren't all that useful to meet everyday needs Ooh, I've got it! I would turn myself invisible, and THEN I would fly around Just for the fun of it I really need to read Harry Potter again so I can remember all those spells My wand wood be made of maple wood And have a No, not maple! It would be a cherrywood wand And the core would be Phoenix feather And it would be a shorter wand, perhaps eight inches or so Half an inche thick at the base And tapering smaller toward the tip I would probably use the wand every day for one thing or another Would I tell people about it? Probably not I wouldn't want anyone to steal it So I would cast an anti-theft charm on it And it would always reappear where I left it if anyone nabbed it And it would give them a little static \"pzzt!\" Just for good measure So I wouldn't have to worry about that problem I still don't think I would tell many people about ir Wouldn't want anyone to be too jelly, you know Another thing I would do is go snorkeling with a bubble-head charm And I could breathe indefinitely I wonder how Voldemort did that flying move while chasing Harry It never gets explained Perhaps it was completely unprecedented? He made up that spell, like Severus did? I could see that And if so, perhaps Dumbledore made up spells But I digress! Oh, the places I'd go Hawaii, the Bahamas, maybe Cuba... Just to say I was there The south pole! It would be so easy to get there But also very cold, so I would have to dress warm China would be sweet to visit And I could change my appearance to look Chinese And have my words automatically translated when I spoke them And visa versa So I could talk to anyone in the whole world! Now that would be neat indeed Well, this devotional is about to start Let's get to it, shall we! Brother Owen is speaking Goodbye!",

        "body": "Hello! I have a sneaking suspicion that you're chitchatter23. If you are, I never get to talk to you anymore. Which is a shame. I really enjoyed our little talks. And if you're not, then, um, it's also good to talk to you! I haven't met anyone I haven't liked yet, so that's great. I'm always open to meeting new people; and I'm even more open to continuing to talk to those new people. It's so fun, all these people meeting and talking and being friendly and having no other purpose than to chat. Or, actually, I guess they DO have a purpose, but it's more prize-related and stuff. And the only way to get that prize is to chat, so, technically, it all comes down to chatting. But I don't like chatting on my own. It's kinda sad, and I don't want to mess up their metrics, you know? I don't think I'm trying to throw anything off; I just feel their data would be more accurate if there were two people talking. And that's not what I'm trying to do at all. I'd hope that any chat data is still viable, even if it's one-way, but that's a little cruel if it's not. I suppose they want two way communication, so listening to a single ramble isn't nearly as effective as a real two-person conversation. A conversation requires two parts; otherwise, it's just a monologue. Or maybe they're hunting for text patterns to emulate to make the person sound more human? See, I just don't know! In one case, it's okay to stay here and talk, and in the other, I should probably get off now. But I kinda enjoy the soliloquizing, if I do say so myself. Hey! I typed that word without red squigglies. That just made my day. And I'm even happier that I knew how to use that word in its proper context. I didn't even know I knew HOW to use that word--or that the word existed I guess my old days of Shakespeare are kicking in. So what do I do, though? I don't consider it wrong to stay here because I'm still giving them more data, but at the same time, I'm not certain about that. Oh, my goodness, is that the time? Eeef, never mind. I might have to get off soon, anyway. I have someone I need to tutor, and they live about half hour away. Plus, there's the whole \"finish getting ready\" part that I need to do, and that's going to take maybe ten minutes or something, I dunno. Not sure. But anyway, I can't stick around for much longer. It would've been nice to chat with you! It's okay, though. Maybe next time. If there is a next time. If not? Well, then at least we tried here. And it's okay. Not everything works out the first time you try. The important thing is to keep trying--or, in this case, to keep chatting! I'm sure I'll run into you for real when the time comes. Till then, I wish you the best of luck in whatever your endeavors are and hope everything else goes well! See you, okay?",

That seems wicked awesome but also super scary. I don't think that I could do it. I have a fear of heights and doing crazy things like skydiving. Although it may be fairly safe, I fear that I wouldn't make it out alive. Out of the plane that is haha I would probably be screaming my head off. I would ask to be the copilot and just go down in the plane because I wouldn't jump. I'd be too scared. And then I probably wouldn't pull the cord of the parachute because I would be freaking out. Have a great day!",

        "body": "nice So are you going to be up till like 3 watching movies again tongiht? tonight Also the conversation would get really lame really fast if two computers started talking to each other Their conversations would hardly ever deviate from very simple phrases I'm seriously like exhausted right now but chit chat is life You'll have to come check out the new office set up it's nice although they're renevating the room next door so there is like a ton of dust everywhere We had to leave the office today early because there was too much dust in the air I'm not sure if I ever told you about this but I once wrote a book about a dwarf lol It finds this big dragons egg in the caves where he works and basically saves the world Oh by the way, I have no idea what to do with the xbox 360 at the office.  If you have any ideas of what to do with it let me know. I'm debating bringing it home, but I feel like I'll just play videogames all the time if that happens And that wouldn't be good My dog is being a little turd She won't go to the bathroom and I just want her to go to bed for the night What is your opinion on college education and if it's worth it? I personally am a little torn. Because like with computer science you can learn a lot without having to go to college or with very little education Because like with Tanner, he was making good money without needing to work.  But at the same time, a college education can get you a lot bigger job with a lot more moey money I think that as long as the tuition is reasonable then it is worth it. But I don't know how worth it it is for universities where people pay like $25 k a semester.  That's just a ton of money You'll be paying it off for years upon years after school And with tuitions just continuously increasing it's kind of getting ridiculous another topic that I am curious about your opinion on is whether or not it's a good or bad thing that we use our phones and computers so much Like for me I find it so productive and I learn so much on my computer and phone, but a lot of people make the argument that it de-socializes people from each other Me personally I think that it's really just social media that's stupid but many would argue that there are a lot of great things that come from it. Like social changes and political influence and stuff like that. I personally am just not a fan of any of it I think Instagram is like the only social platform I'm like semi-okay with The other thing that I find a little silly is the argument about video games increasing violence among the population I find that argument just dumb Granted yes, it does cause some serious issues for some kids and adults.  Like some people do just have like a problem that causes lots of issues in their lives, but I think it's stupid when people try and say there is a direct correlation between video games and violence. Granted I may be completely  wrong, but I would need to see some hard evidence proving it in order to believe it. Now something I am totally excited for with video games is the fact that it's becoming more of a sport now I think it would be pretty cool to see video games in the olympics Whether that be Fortnite or League of Legends or some other game that the whole world plays. It would be so much fun to see. That and drone racing! I didn't actually get to watch this seasons tournaments but last year I actually followed drone racing pretty closely It was really cool! Like they go so fast through the hoops and buildings anyways, pretty cool stuff I'm really interested to see what happens with the stock market in the coming weeks. It's been in a free fall for a couple days now Apparently everyone is starting to panic because interest rates have just about topped out and that's typically a sign of a downturn in the market so people are trying to get out while they're on top I think i'm going to try and sleep in till like 8 or 9 tomorrow I have a class at 11 but I honestly don't even know if I want to go to that class It's a bio class and honestly we don't even talk about a whole lot in there So I may just sleep in some more ahha probably shouldn't I should just go to the class and get it over with Okay, I'm going to call it quits for the night fun talking to you! see you tomorrow!",

I've also heard that even sending water can hurt others if not sent to the right people who can distribute it. Often emergency personnel talk about two disasters--the actual disaster and the one that comes after with all the good-meaning people sending just a ton of random stuff. What are you passionate about? Donating blood what about you? Donating blood. What about you? Hello? So am I supposed to be chatting with someone? Or just to my self? Start Eve? Alexa? Hello? Anyone there? So I think that another great cause is to donate to BYU. They do great research there. I especially like how are doing the chit-chat challenge.",

And how that's not true and keeps people from trying new things. Like, in order to write a book I have to be an writer/author! But how would you ever get there without starting? OR I'd give a ted talk about how I wish I would have learned earlier in life that it is so much fun and beneficial to broaden your horizons and try new things. Like, I'm a computer science guy but I also started dancing! Would never have done that had I not tried it one day. OR I'd give a Ted talk about how opening your mouth and talking to people can get you a lot of placed. places*",

Please someone be ther This will make 3 chats in a row where the person on the other end doesn't respond at all the entire chat I end up just talking to myself for like 10 minutes before just giving up on waiting I just got back from a midterm review and my dog got herself out of her crate somehow She was just running around all happy and giddy I think she got into some goldfish... Very naughty dog. She's now snuggling up as if she didn't do anything wrong. Seriously dogs are the worst.  They do stupid things, but then act so cute that you can't get mad at them. I bike to and from campus each day and this weather is just not helping at all. I enjoy the cold, but the air quality is getting pretty bad here in Utah and it hurts my chest having to bike in this weather honestly. So, not sure if anyone is ever going to join this chat. I'm probably just going to go.  Although it's great racking up lots of easy points, it's pretty lame talking to myself for extended periods of time. If you would like me to stay in the chat then please respond in the next 20 seconds. I'll wait... okay. Well, I'm going to go.  See you!",

        "body": "My modern day hero... You know, I've always had a hard time answering that question I can never think of a way to answer it without feeling cliche Even back in my elementary school days It also appears no one else is on this chat right now So I can chat about whatever I want! Anarchy! But seriously There are plenty more adventures to be had Today's story will follow the characters Xander, Harold, and Quincy Xander: hello friends! How would you like to go skiing? Albert: if you bring the poles, I'm in! Xander: Albert? I, uh, don't know any Alberts... Harold: haha, just kidding. I'm actually Harold. As I was saying, I just don't want to rent poles this time. Xander: no worries, I can cover for you. I have extras. What about you, Quincy? Quincy: I don't know...last time I went skiing was a bit of a fiasco Xander: why, what happened? It was that bad? Quincy: yeah. I crashed into a hot dog stand at the bottom of a super steep slope Harold: that's awful! Quincy: there was ketchup and mustard everywhere. Xander: ok, well, this time will be different! We can get you skis that fit well... Quincy: I'll think about it. When are you planning to go? Xander: oh, I was thinking like 5 or 6. It doesn't really matter to me, I just need to get out. Harold: I'm available anytime after 5, so that should work for me. Xander: sweet! I'll work on getting all of my equipment together. Quincy: *shudders to himself* ketchup...mustard...oven-hot franks.... (Quincy begins to relive his terrifying experience via monologue and flashback. I see the snow, whiter than titanium dioxide Glinting with a maniacal joy at the prospect of yet another victim I feel myself moving faster and faster, headlong down the hill I cannot stop Any faster and it seems I will time travel And that's when I see it: the hot dog stand It is small, no more than a cart, but at this speed everything looks dangerous I try to steer away, but the snow rips the poles from my hands And my oversized skis pull me wherever the snow dips down My path is taking me straight to the stand There is nothing I can do, so I just scream at the hot dog man to get out of the way Seeing me, he yelps and dives to the side in the nick of time And then....CRASH!!!!! My vision is filled with the explosion of white snow, red ketchup, yellow mustard, and green pickles And then the blackness takes me When I come to, I am in a pile of franks and all manner of condiments The stand itself is nowhere to be seen. Either rolled away or was vaporized by the impact,  I figure At least I'm alive. And these hot dogs are warm. I knew I should've gone bowling today instead Fortunately, no bones were broken due to the cushioning provided by the snow However, some bruises were obtained But I count myself lucky Though, truth be told, I don't really want to go skiing again anytime soon I suppose that's life for you... Harold: wow, you've got quite the memory, man! Quincy: oh no! You heard that whole thing? How? It was just in my head! Harold: c'mon, man! You know I'm a mind reader! Quincy: yeah, actually NO, I didn't know that! Harold: you do now! Quincy: haha. Very funny. You shall never speak of this. Harold: I cam agree to that, but there's really no need. Xander heard the whole thing too. Quincy: WHAAAT???? Xander: hey, uh, yeah, sorry about that.... Quincy: I can't believe you guys have been spying on me this whole time. Xander: don't take it so personally, we're just bored. Nothing else to do. Quincy: well, if its cheap entertainment you want, I guess you came to the right place Harold: that's the spirit! I knew we could count on you :) Xander: I agree. Thank goodness we're all part of the triumvirate Quincy: the, uh, what now? Xander: you know, like in ancient Rome! There were three people with an equal  amount of power Harold: and they tried to share it with each other? Xander: exactly, except it didn't work so well. People are just so greedy, they tried taking each other out. And not to dinner.... Quincy: wait...so then what does that mean for us? If we ARE the triumvirate? Xander: hehehehe Harold: hehehehe Quincy: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! (Thus concludes the tale of the ill-fated modern triumvirate. Tune in next week to learn about the tactics of the fearsome sea snake)",

How are you doing today I think true artificial intelligence is when a computer can make decisions and reacts with the same kind of emotion that a human Wood Wood I'm doing this on my phone right now so it keeps on auto correcting my typing I've been so busy these past couple weeks because of midterms I've had big projects in test to take I just finished my last test last night. All I have left is a project that I need to turn in by midnight tonight It looks like I'm just talking to myself again The last round I only ended up talking to myself because people would just leave it open and never respond I started a Google ad campaign for this business that I'm running. I set the budget at a fixed amount and Google ended up running the ad five times more than what that amount Generated. So I've since taking the ad down ha ha I've now started looking into linked in emails If you are a business you can actually get hundreds and thousands of emails from LinkedIn of people specific professions and specific fields And then you can send them adds through the emails. The place where I work currently we found that 25% of all the emails we send out get clicked. With ads on google it typically takes about 100 views to get a click with these emails we found that it takes for to get a click. So overall it's totally worth the money comparatively because you get so much more traffic in so much more marketing power from it. So I've start actually look into researching doing that for my own business. I'm hoping that I can get in traffic that I'll be refusing customers for the time being. I'm gonna be so busy today with this project that I have. I'm making application using express JAS Jay SS Js Sorry AutoCorrect keeps fixing that Anyways the idea is that I built a server for my for this website And then I build out the front end of it and connect to the server that I built on the backend I'm just having some issues with a request function so I need to go in and get some help fixing that today with the TA Everything else is working just fine but I'm getting this weird error that I've never come across before OK well I'm going to go nice talking to myself I guess See you later",

With all the recent policy/structural changes in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I think it's important to recognize how change can be a really good thing Although, understandably, change isn't always a good thing. A lot of it depends on your perspective and attitude. Something I've been studying about recently is climate change in Europe. Sadly, however, much of the change associated with climate change is quite negative. I do wonder if it will force us to adapt more rapidly - to create better technology and new methods of transportation, entertainment, even shopping which will not only improve the environment, but maybe even help reverse some of the negative effects of human interactions on the planet. I'm no scientist, but it does make me wonder.",

        "body": "Hello, hello! Wow, it feels different to type on this laptop. Makes me want to switch to my Chromebook. It's nice and . . . homey, I guess you could say. This one, as nice as it is, just doesn't have that same familiar ring to it. But it DOES have a numpad, which, you have to admit, is pretty nice in a laptop. Anyway, that's just me being picky about computers. I suppose everybody would get picky if they spent enough time around them. I'm trying to get my typing speed up, see. It's a little more difficult than I'd thought but also intuitive. And I can type so quickly on that little chromebook of mine. I couldn't even say why. If I had to guess, I'd say it has something to do with how closely those letters are - spaced, but I couldn't be sure. You, um, you there? Helloooo? Am I talking to an empty room? As much as I enjoy these one-sided chats, it seems a little . . . well, a little sad and lonely, if I'm to be honest. I don't want to hold all these conversations by themselves; they're SO much nicer when there's a second person. Or, hey! Even a third person would be great. I sometimes wish that there was a more active playerbase on here, you know? More people to talk to beyond the typical ghosts that seem so intent on stalking here? I guess I can't complain. I wouldn't want to chat, either, if there weren't any prizes involved for me. It's currently just me and, uh, whoever the top dog is. I can't believe he scored something like .7 million while I was gone. .7 million! Do you know how many hours of chatting that is? I'll give you a hint: It's a lot. Of course, it depends on how quickly you can type. And also how quickly the other person responds. Some people can type LIGHTNING quick on here, let me tell you. I met this one guy, real nice Asian I think, who could type at something crazy like 120 words per minute. I was struggling to keep up with all his chats. It was fun, actually, the speed. It was a struggle for sure, but it really was a nice change of pace from the regular conversation speeds I have. Holy cow. Wow. I, um, I did that. Sorry. I just checked the leaderboard. Look at that! Do you see that? I don't know if you've noticed, but there's been a person on the leaderboard creeping up slowly over these past few minutes. Wanna know who that is? I'll give you another hint: Her name starts with \"K\" and ends with \"J.\" Which . . . . . . would be a lot more interesting if I were actually getting responses from you. I, um, know that you're not there. And I guess that's okay. It's better than waiting idly for who knows how long, but not by much. Just, um, whenever you get online, I'd love to chat with you, okay? I'm serious. Just whenever, all right? I'm going to end now. Not much point when the other end is as dead as the sea over in . . . Europe, I believe? But, ah, I hope I see you again. It would've been great to get to know you. Take care, all right? And try not to die during finals! . . . unless you're already done. In which case, try not to die during next midterm's crazy rush! Okay, okay, I'm leaving now. For reals. See you later!",

It works for parties, for meeting, for a get together. perf I also really like queso though, it is so elegant and also makes my mouth water at the sight of it. It makes me want more and more, Much like light and the way it grows My favorite food is ramen noodles. The kind that has tons of toppings on it and is super rich tasting. I've just always loved soup a ton and it is my favorite type of soup  so it has to be up in my top 4 brighter and brighter till the perfect day Not only does it come in a surprising range of flavors and toppings, but it can be changed to suit the needs of whoever is eating it. Inherently it is a descriptive food i like whatever lord farquaad likes Think of everyone you know, they all have a favorite pizza. Places are wildly revered for their fantastic pizzas. Chicago was built on their signature pizza I mean just think about it",

Could it therefore be killed? In Star Wars, this seems to be the case Droids have personalities, and function much like humans do I would consider that true AI A thinking machine would also be interesting in the sense that its brain would just be computer memory How would that work? Could an artificial brain be placed into any contraption to create any type of robot? That could be sketchy Anything with AI would also need some sort of moral code to know what actions it should take Because surely anything that thinks like a human should be given freedom To some extent, I suppose It makes me think of the recent Star Wars movie \"Solo\" How that one droid (I can't remember \"her\" name) keeps pushing for droids' rights There's the scene where two droids are made to fight each other, much like a dogfight Would that kind of thing be legal if robots here had AI? They can't feel pain Hmmmmmm I wonder if true AI would have to include the ability to feel pain That could fall under the emotion category, I suppose So let's summarize would true AI would require: 1. A keen awareness of the world around it 2. An awareness of its own awareness 3. The ability to engage in rational thought 4. A built in moral code that would guide it to make good, society-friendly decisions 5. The ability to continue learning new information 6. The capacity to feel emotion and react to it accordingly Those are the top six things, I would say I'm sure there are many other qualities that would be necessary or at least convenient Thank you for tuning in to \"AI with TJ!\" Next week: raisin bran! \"Does it think? Does it want to? Could cereal be made intelligent? Tune in next week to find out! *music plays* *Fade out* *Commercial begins*",

        "body": "Then some things would certainly be different around here... Not much would change for the average person, just for the pig farmers They would have to put roofs over all the pigs pen that they operated And....probably not much else, actually Depending on what the pigs' wings were like, perhaps they could be clipped Like chickens' wings So they couldn't fly away Now, I'm assuming this question means pigs flying in their own power Pigs can already fly in planes and helicopters and space shuttles Just like people cab *can If the question DID mean that, I would answer something like \"cool\" Or \"so what\" Which is why I assume the former meaning was intended I still stand by my conjecture that not many things would change Perhaps bacon and pork chops would taste differently if pigs had wings? Butchers would have to use different cuts to account for the wing muscles But would that really be so hard? I don't think so Another result would be that pigs would live on mountains more commonly But back to the butcher thing, I wonder if the market value for pork would go up or down I would estimate that they would stay the same Because, although there would be more wing muscle, there would be less leg muscle Because the pigs probably wouldn't walk as much... So the net amount of muscle would remain unchanged On another note, the kind of wings the pigs would need to go airborn would have to be massive Because pigs are so heavy Unless, of course, this was a specialized breed of pig that had hollow bones like a bird If the pigs had wings like a bat, they couldn't be clipped as I mentioned earlier But maybe the pigs would be tiny! Bat-sized, even! Now THAT would be something Also, if pigs could fly they would have to deal with birds somehow If they were full sized, they would rule the skies in splendor If they were small, they would likely get eaten That would be sad I imagine that flying pigs would be pretty cute Wait, pigs HAVE flown before! In a hurricane? The bay of pigs fiasco? Actually that may be different.... Now I'm thinking of world war 2 The Cuban invasion with Teddy Roosevelt Still, I'm fairly certain that pigs have been carried in tornado winds I'm sure it was a scary day for them I wonder if any got stuck in trees That's happened to cows before I learned that in elementary school It probably wasn't very comfortable for them I'm really running out of ways to answer this question Would more people want pigs as pets? Or would they be less desirable? I know some people are fond of potbelly pigs Personally, I don't think I would ever get one But to each his own I guess But a flying one, perhaps... For novelty if nothing else I would name my flying pig Babe Jr. Of course, if I had one in my possession But I believe the end of this exciting conversation must needs be drawing nigh So, sayonara world of chit chatting! Until we meet again!",

And are we meant to? Would computers end up as robots, and if they could fall in love does that mean they would also be able to reciprocate other feelings? Because then if they were, you would be able to form friendships with them, and they would be like real people, but machines If they had the same emotional capacity as humans, would we still put them in a different class than humans, such as second class citizens? Would the programmer(s) who programmed the computers to be able to fall in love and have sentience, would they be heralded as heroes, or heathens? These are the deep questions I am leaving with, because you have not answered",

After letting it cool for a while you finally eat it. If a computer becomes indistinguishable from a human is it murder to turn it off? By law no because it is still a computer. And even so..",

To me, if money were not an object then I would totally just go head first into several business Ideas I have and potentially drop out of school to pursue those ideas. I'd probably talk with my wife about potentially not pursuing a career anymore and just being a mom since she could with no financial worries. Probably travel the world with her too for like a full year visiting anywhere and everywhere. And then just finding what I love to work on and doing that just to stay busy and active. Maybe start up a cool foundation to help people with depression or underprivileged communities. That would be pretty neat. I see that I'm just talking to chitchatter23 again. I'm not sure if people just don't pay attention and never check their chats or if they just leave it open without realizing it. I've talked to myself for I'd say probably 50% of the chats this round so far. Because people just don't answer. I'll probably give you like 2 more minutes before I end the chat and go looking for another one. Nice talking to you chitchatter23! See you!",

We worked so hard, but I never felt like I was really sacrificing you know?? It was just doing what I loved everyday hey it was so nice talking to you.

Those who would tell me I was crazy But I would pay them no heed, of course I would be hailed as a hero by all those who believe computer exist to serve and not to be served Man's best friend? No. Not in a year, or even two But inevitably, forces would rise up that would fight for the rights of computers everywhere They would argue that all sentient materials should have rights to decide whether they can be turned off or not And to that I would say \"Ha! You think you can trick me with such trickery? Well then trick or treat to THIS!!!\" and I would then proceed to turn off a computer on a live Broadcast feed There would be riots across the entire American continent Stores would burn in Portland But only those that were insured by business owners insurance Obviously I would probably need a good sized security force to keep me safe from the pro-computer people Would I get involved in politics? Most certainly But I wouldn't stop with the USA, oh no I would make my way to the UN! During this time, computers would doubtless increase there intelligent abilities I would be unable to use any computer that refused to swear fealty to me Dang, I'm starting to sound very totalitarian, aren't I.... I suppose a subject change is in order If you give a computer a mouse, then.... ...he will want to feed it some corn. And you will tell him that the mouse is not a REAL mouse And the computer will ask what makes something \"real\" or not And you will engage in a philosophical discussion about the nature of reality And you will both most likely come out of that confused And then the mouse will ask for a cookie And then for glass of milk And he will accidentally spill it on the computer And maybe some grape juice But he will probably lack the means to throw it off a bridge But if he did, the computer might be abducted by aliens Thereby being saved from a watery splash The computer would then be raised by alien species Who, hopefully,  would respect the computer's wish  not to be turned off And it would enjoy a good life? Who knows You know I'm in an Astronomy class when I start rambling in that direction Oh bother Five seconds until blast off! Yay here we go people! Make that three seconds at this point! Farewell, chit chattery world! I depart, but I shall return before the day is through! Yes indeed! Actually, maybe I'll stay on a bit longer This class is ten minutes from being over, and students are just telling stories, so... Why not, right? That's my reasoning, at least. We're talking about the possibility/probability of life in the universe Elsewhere from Earth Now we're watching an alien parody of a song And the alien got hit with a disco ball Ooh, Carbonaceous Chondrite meteorites You know, I'm fairly surprised no one has joined this chat Seeing how early this is in the competition I hope useful information can be obtained from such ghost-chatting efforts Sixty times, a minute must pass For the seconds to otherwise be Okay, NOW I shall bid you a fond farewell... Until we meet again!!! Toodles!",

I've had lots of chats where the other person either doesn't respond, or the ... ... conversation ends fairly quickly. In other news, my dog gets her stitches out today which is exciting. I haven't been allowed to bathe her until they have been taken out so  I am super excited for that.  She is starting to smell gross. She got spade and also had the little nubs on her back legs cut off. I have this big project coming up in one of my classes, but I really need to do well on my tests that are coming up as well so I can't really work a whole lot on my project because of that unfortunately. Are you a CS major? Okay, well... I think I'm just going to go.  There is only so much I can talk about with myself before I start repeating stuff which would be bad for this project.  They need unique data mainly. Goodbye! Talk to you later!",

Looks like i'm just chatting with myself I like computers they're very fun I study Computer Science and program with my thumb I like computers they make things beep I just had a sandwich and it made me feel complete Poet. I have a lot of stuff to get done before the break I have two teachers who have set up tests for Tuesday before break so that will be lots of fun... My other classes are giving us time off though thankfully okay I'm going to peace out peace out.",

Always listens. Lets me get it all out and rant a bit. Helps me with my problems by being silent enough to let me think about the, them* Is there a limit to how many messages I can send without getting a response? I thought there was. But perhaps I was wrong. Man, I wonder if she is ever going to change her mind. Or rather, if she is ever going to make up her mind. You know what I mean? Gosh, love is the best and worst thing out there. It's not the worst literally. But it can be the source of the greatest pain. God suffers in the sense that he mourns with his children who suffer an weeps for wickedness that is prevalent in the world. And as long as he procreates he will suffer. In that sense. But he lives at a fullness of joy as well. What a thought!",

I'm listening to the soundtrack right now It's so good! Friend, you don't say much And yet, you say so much So, back to the TED talks I watched one about the danger of a single story I HIGHLY recommend you take a moment to watch it It's so good It's by a woman from Nigeria She talks about how important it is to have diversity in representation It's so accurate! I mean, that's why we have such a big issue with ignorance nowadays People are sometimes so used to hearing only one side of a story that it becomes their only reality All right, friend This has been a very enriching conversation, I hope you've learned as much as I have Now I have to go!

Finally, a prompt other than something about computers I think the last film that made an impression on me was Ready Player One I really liked that movie and actually watched it twice and still picked up a lot of new things from it the second time.

I don't mean to spam your chat by the way, just want to make good use of words and rack my score up instead of waiting.  Sorry! Chances are we've probably spoken before.  I think that I end up speaking to someone I've already spoken to like nine times out of ten They need to announce the challenge more frequently because there aren't a ton of people participating.

I guess it's called process of elimination. Or natural selection. Or we just need epi-pen manufacturers. But I guess the epi-pens would be made out of peanuts too so the person would still die. Maybe this isn't such a great idea to make everything peanut butter.... So...would peanut butter freeze in Russia? Or melt in the sweltering heat of Texas? I just don't think it's a great idea to make everything out of peanut butter. Also, what advantages would it have? I guess you could have a bunch of free, high-protein meals. And unlimited peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Or just peanut butter sandwiches. With peanut butter bread.",

I guess it's theoretically possible that I could have a flying car when no one else does. Just unlikely. If I had a flying car, I would probably be a taxi for the richest people in the world. That way I could keep earning money despite probably having spent it all on a flying car! That would be good, I think. It's a hard question, though! If I had a flying car, there would be a lot of things that I could do. Be a taxi. Get anywhere I wanted to go. Just fly all over everywhere. Just have a fun time doing absolutely anything in the car! But I'm not sure. Because honestly I don't know what I would do with a lot of things if I had them. Probably not that much, to be honest. Beause even if I had a lot of things, I would probably just sit around and still read books. I really like reading books. There are lots of good books out there!

        "body": "Hello! Nice to see you again. You spoke so quickly, I see your response before the CCC prompt. (I just realized I haven't read the prompt to speak in, um, many turns.) Do most people talk about the prompt? Maybe I'm just strange, but I find it a little . . . boring, to be honest. Most of them, at least. Not that the prompts are bad! I think they're rather clever, being frank. But I suppose I've never liked having a predefined pattern for the conversation to follow. It's nice when you feel like you're ACTUALLY talking to somebody else instead of following a script someone else made, you know? And I think part of the reason that I love to be on here so much is that I DON'T feel required to fit a mold. They just want chatting, right? Well, I can chat. Heh, I can chat a LOT, apparently. And, more than that . . . I'm kinda determined to win. I think someone else is as determined as I am, which makes it difficult, but what do you do? I'm going to be off later today, which, um, is probably going to be problematic. Man. I have things I need to do, I just realized. Nothing too crazy, but I DO have to set up a schedule for math tutoring. It shouldn't be too hard; just time consuming. I'm thinking it shouldn't take me longer than, like, three hours at most. (I'm trying to be pessimistic with my time so that I'm not frequently surprised by how long things - take. I've been consistently wrong about how long things take.) But, the problem is, unless I want to be up until midnight tonight, I can't get started on it at all. Or, hang on, let me phrase that in a way that makes sense. I don't want to do the schedule right now because I'm worried that I'm going to lose my ranking. I've invested a lot of time into here. A LOT. Trust me on that. I think I'm nearing, what . . . fifteen hours? . . . which, okay, isn't that much. But it's still pretty consistent. Actually, if we go on the higher bounds of scoring and say that I earn 100,000 in a single hour, then with my 5.7 million points, that's . . . 57 hours? Uhhhhh, I don't think I've put in THAT much time. That's a lot. That's really a lot. And if we go on the flipside and say that I earned 300,000 in an hour, then at 5.7 million, that's still . . .  18 hours. Ooof. I have less of a life than I'd thought. There are two solutions to this, then. I either up my typing speed, or I spend more time chatting. Or both. Regardless, I'm not throwing 20+ hours down the drain because I wasn't willing to suck it up a few more days. Puh-leaze. I can handle a few more days. I worked a fast food job for a bit, and I would've gotten the same amount of hours in four days of work. I'm not ecstatic about having to babysit my score, no, but it's something I'm certainly willing to do. I . . . want to prove to myself that I can do it. I very very nearly quit early on. He was 1.5 million points ahead of me, and I just . . . oooh, I very nearly quit right then. 1.5 million points is, what, seven hours of talking? Maybe 10? He was so far ahead--and he continued to climb. The funny thing was (I may have told you already, so bear with me), I was planning on doing the same thing to him: get so far ahead that he loses hope of winning at stops - trying. It's a good tactic, apparently. *and Well, I asked myself if I really wanted to win, if it was worth it. I wanted an iPad, sure, but it was more . . . it was more that I'd told myself I was winning that iPad. If I couldn't do this, something that's relatively simple, how on earth am I supposed to keep my bigger commitments? *was I And when I was looking at that 1.5 million spread, something that looked bleak and hopeless, I had to choose. Do I fight my way back up, knowing it may be fruitless and that I'll lose every hour I invested into this? Or do I quit now? Because what's the point of investing time and energy and hope into something that was bound to fail, anyway? That last one was critical to me. I didn't want to hope for something I thought was impossible. Time and energy are something I had in abundance (though, I have arguably less now, for some reason). I didn't care all the much of I lost what I'd put into it already. *all that much if No, it . . . it was more the fact that I could . . . do it. That I, myself, could do it. That there would be a single winner, and that winner would be me. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the prize; that much is true. No point in investing myself into something that's not going to pay. But . . . I also wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could win. I wouldn't be here if I didn't have a small fire within me that's calling me to do it. It's a very strange sensation. I've never been an ambitious person. It's not that I never did well in school or anything. I did. But . . . I didn't have my sights set very high. No reason to. I was content with being good with where I was, and there wasn't more to that. Well . . . I ran into a classmate a while back. I knew him, of course, but I'd never really gotten the chance to talk to him. I'm not even sure what changed. I knew he had internships to places, but . . . I don't know. One day, he came back talking about how he got this internship at Vanguard, and I asked him about his past and whatnot, where I found out that he'd already had four summer - internships, starting when he was sixteen. He was talking about graduate school and various other places, and then, get this, he started talking about Google. Yes, as in THE Google. One of the top five tech places to work. He landed a few interviews with them, and now he's just waiting the call back to see if he made it. (Technically, he has one interview left to complete, but he finishes this - week.) Somewhere along the way . . . somewhere, I think I gained a small ambition. Me, who's never been ambitious for anything aside from getting into BYU, suddenly had her eyes opened to a new world. A world where you can achieve so much if you set your heart to it. If the sacrifice is worth it, if the struggle is worth it, if the pain is worth it, you can go out and touch your dreams. Oh, whoops! I forgot this was still open. I got sidetracked. Well, ah, if you're not here by now, you probably won't be later. Hope I see you again, Pito! Uh, hey?",

        "body": "Hello, hello! It's so nice to see a person here. Or ARE you a person, hmm? I see a lot of ghosts. I don't think people mean to ghost me, but they're often away from their computers when I join. And sometimes, they dno't get back until many minutes afterwards. *don't But it's all right. I kinda enjoy talking to myself, even if it's not the most effective for conversations. Or, rather, data for conversations. I don't want to stilt the data because, well, that's the entire reason they're here, but at the same time, it's so difficult to find people to talk to. I'm hoping that you return soon. Because if you don't, well, I'll stay here, but I'll keep wanting you to show up. Conversations are so much better with two people! I think implicit in the word \"converse\" is the assumption that there are two or more parties participating. Here, there's not a whole lot of that. It's more a monologue, not a dialogue. So, as much as I love staying here and chatting my ear off, I think it's wiser if I wait for somebody else to show up. It's not you! It's just the fact that you're not here, you know? Though, if you were to show up last minute, I'd be happy to continue the conversation with you. But I doubt that's going to happen. I appreciate you keeping the window open, though. Gives me a chance to practice my typing skills and whatnot. Pretend for a moment that I'm actually doing something important. You know, I think it might be nice to stay just for a little bit longer. But . . . I don't know, I'm okay with chatting for a little bit by myself, but anything more than that just feels off. Anyway, I'll see you. Bye! Take care!",

He fought and won two different belts in two different weight classes simultaneously. He has great style, and crazy confidence in himself. He is one of those guys that believes everything he says will come true and it does most of the time. His nick name is mystic mac. He got this nick name by predicting a lot of the outcomes of the fights he's had. He's the absolute best. Recently he's become more of a business man though, he's taken a little break from the fight business and is starting his own whiskey company called proper 12 He recently did a big release of it in Dallas. He was on the field with the Dallas Cowboys and they even let him throw the ball. He didn't have a very good throw. But what do you expect from a professional MMA fighter, Football just isn't his game. When he was critsized for his bad throw this is what he said: \"I was trying not to rip my custom made August McGregor baby blue billionaire blazer\" What a baller. You know I would really love to win this BYU chit chat challenge. I would like to surprise my wife with a new iPad. We would actually share it and use it for school and things like that! Wouldn't that be awesome! In a world like today technology is a must. Its kind of sad but in order to function and in a way fit in you need to have all the latest technology. Alot of everything that we do relies on techonology. All of our school work is online, books are online, assignments are online, we buy things online. It would be an inconvenience to not be able to use the internet or have access to modern day techonology.",

I think He's a good guy but he's stretching himself too thin and not making great personal management choices. I've gotta say I love Chris Pratt though Like, he's a pretty good actor and all. But also he's hilarious and just down to earth and a good guy. He goes to work on some hardcore ranch when he's not filming And it's like a legit ranch too, not like how a lot of celebrities own ranches to own them. I don't even know if he owns the ranch But he goes and herds sheep and milks cows and cuts down trees and just does hard work. Which I think is healthy for the soul. And he's not afraid of talking about his beliefs in public which is a big deal. Especially since hollywood is mostly against his beliefs. I really hope he stays as good as he seems It's possible that he changes or gives up good things in his life over time. Which happens a lot with actors. But for now, he's cool. Are you there? Ok, I'm gonna go now. Bye!",

It's okay if you're preoccupied and are away for a moment, but it's a different thing entirely when you're permanently gone. Because then it really is just a one-sided conversation--and not an interesting one, at that. I don't particularly mind; I'm okay with keeping myself company. But I worry about how that affects everyone else. It's a little rude to stay here and chat myself, don't you think? And I don't WANT to skew numbers. I find that wrong. So I really do want to give them good data. I feel that good data is something they could always use. But . . . I don't know, I'm not sure that's possible if I don't find another person to chat with. There have been some lovely people I've met on here. People I genuinely would like to talk to again given the chance. I can't do that if I stay here, but if I leave, there's a chance I won't be able to talk again for a long time. I don't know. We'll see. I'm glad to have spent a little bit of time with you, though. Take care, all right?",

My best friend is my wife and she knows everything so thats why I said that there isn't something that my best friend nows about me. Life is good when your best friend is your wife. I strongly reccommend marrying your best friend. So what do you have going on today? Anything interesting? How was your halloween night last night? I didn't do much, I just hung out with family and ate pizza and candy haha. I also studied for a test that I have. Lots of trick or treaters came to our house though haha. It's crazy how many people were in our neighborhood. So right now I'm studying for a test in Biochemistry. I'm learning about antibodies. Apparently antibodies are used to tag proteins. They have a reporter function used to determine the presence of a specific protein in a gel. Western blot analysis or immunoblot analysis incubates protein transferred from a gel to nitrocellulose paper with an antibody speicific to the protein of interest. The advantages of this is that it is very sensitive to change. LIke it can bind to really low concentrations of protein so that its given good readings even at low concentrations. It is also very specific. The antibodies are able to recognize a single molecule amoung many. couple with high binding affinity this is been useful in many clinical tests. Well, thats enough ranting for me. What are you learning about in school? What are you studying? I actually have to go now and get ready for school. Good luck with everything!",

Although, this would be really sad actually because I have a wife and a baby so they would be gone too. I would be really lonely. Kinda like in that movie, Cast Away.

I feel like I just am constantly talking to myself... And it gets really boring They should announce the Chit chat challenge to more people so that we get more than just the regular few people on here every day Currently it's like just me and that other person named KJ, and no one else really participates. I feel like they'd be way more motivated to announce it to others so that they can get more quality data.  Because right now they aren't getting a lot of participation and therefore not a lot of data. If they just made an announcement on some department slack channels or send an email blast out to certain clubs they would get a lot more participation. I mean I am happy because it makes it easier for us to win prizes, but it ends up just being like this all the time, where no one actually participates. Off topic, I've got a bike that has a tire that's going flat, but the pumps on campus are broken for the most part, so if you try to fill up your tire then it ends up just deflating it even more than it already is.  I'm not sure what to do. I don't have a pump, but I might buy one because of this problem. I emailed University Accessibility dept.  and they never responded about fixing the pumps.  It's really not difficult to do too... It would cost a total of like $20 including paying the maintenence people to replace those pumps.  Because it's just the nozzle portion that doesn't function properly. I think I should just buy myself a pump.  I'm just lazy and cheap haha. Who knows, maybe they'll fix the pumps someday soon. I just don't want to bike to campus, use it, and then I get stranded on campus because my bike can't make it off campus. It's a very long walk to my place too which makes it a little difficult. Okay well, I've got to go.  Pretty bummed out that I haven't talked to anyone today.  I just keep getting these ghost chat rooms it feels like because people don't pay attention. See you later!",

        "body": "Yo, you see lebron the other night I'm in class as well I've been chatting for quite some time actually, but my other friend had to leave Yo I'm not sure if I told you about my business idea or not last night About having an outsourcing company to handle data validation and customer care Basically I've been doing some research and it costs most companies roughly $20 per person to have a call center that they control and manage obviously that's kind of pricey, so they outsource a lot Most call centers in Utah average about $12 wages that they pay their employees, the national average is $13.86 I've found that here in Provo with the large college population between UVU and BYU I'm able to charge just $10.50 an hour for their services And in addition to that, most of them are RM's who can speak foreign languages and don't mind call center kind of work because they are used to rejection and getting yelled at So I'm able to compete in this market at equal or slightly lower charges and deliver higher quality service through these quality student employees that I will employ I've spoken with 2 companies so far and both have outsourced work to India before and had terrible experiences. Funny thing is one of the CEO's is actually from there so it was kind of irronic. But basically they expressed concerns about a need for outsourcing work within the US, but it can get kind of pricey and it can be a little unreliable too. So that's where I kind of swoop in with this edge that I have on competitors.  I still would need to work out the details for actual expenses, equipment, rent etc. But overall the idea seems sound. The other thing I want to do is create a system that can basically incorporate machine learning to see which calls should be handled with care and as a priority. It would be able to interpret tone of voice and word usage during hold time questions and associate those tones and words with the outcome of the call.  That way eventually it can start to pick up on what kinds of tones should encourage a decreased hold time for that given user. It would improve relations with customers drastically. I think that's where the most money could come from honestly.  Being able to sell those algorithms to other call centers and large companies Or instead of cutting them in front of others it would simply send them directly to a manager that way they are in the best hands instead of just a regular CSR I've got a lot of ideas in this field, but I think for now my focus is going to be on launching this outsourcing business Software and buisness expansion can come afterwords This will be more of a cash cow to fuel my R&D within this field. I think I'd really like to bring someone else on in the CS department who can help me build out a software solution to handling multiple different businesses being contracted to us. Like each company uses different products and softwares to handle their clients and their scheduling etc. I would want to build a system that could be universal in addressing all client needs, but we could customize it for each company we work with and connect it to whatever systems they use I'm not sure if that's an easy thing to do or if there exists a system out there that does that, but that would be ideal for me We could potentially just handle very specific calls for these companies, say purely just complaints or customer support/ how to sort of thing That way no customized interface is needed the CSR's just need to be trained to handle different problems I had another idea as well that I'm not sure if I want to run with yet or not Basically there is a huge database out there with all the historical markers across the country and the words written on them. I could build an app that pulls your location and determines what are the closest markers to you. Upon driving up to those markers you could read exactly what they say off of your phone instead of having to get out of the car to read it It would be great for Sunday drives or for cross country trips, etc. Although these signs are super outdated, older generations would love it. You could sell ad space as well companies that are close by could put up ads trying to send them in the direction of their businesses I would first allow it to get streamlined so everyone is using it, and then I could add the ad features once it's proven successful I have this one class that I'm in where we have this project we have to create a process poster of something that people could basically learn to do So I'm doing mine on how to make a process poster so it's a process poster poster super clever I'm going to be taking this entrepreneurship class next semester and am hoping that I can actually use this idea that I have for that class and further work on it through that class I don't know if my partner would be on board with it though If not that's fine by me since I already have that idea I am fine working on something else as well and just kind of riding whichever idea works out better Maybe that second Idea I'll present to my partner and see if we want to build that out while I simultaneously handle the outsourcing company I could see that really kicking off honestly And I know you are an accounting major, you could help me out with setting up my books and setting up taxes, payroll, etc. And insuring that financially I'll be on track for solid growth That would be really helpful actually I could either A)pay you 10.50 like all the other employees, or b) give you a share in the business in return for free services Basically you'd just be investing in this idea with me I am really excited for this party I'm going to tonight It's going to be at one of the founder's homes and coach Sitake and some of the players will be there too so that should be a lot of fun Cool visitors, good food I'm excited I'm curious how we are going to do against Hawaii tomorrow they are 6 and 1 and yet we are favored to win 90% we are favored by 11.5 points I honestly am a little worried. I don't know if we will actually win this game.  They are a pretty good team. So we will see what happens I am getting really tired of typing in chit chat It is very difficult to keep this up for long periods of time I will probably stop around 2:50 and pick it up again later tonight like late late tonight I will be pretty busy during the day so unfortunately i may lose my placing on top, but I will get it back tonight I am really excited for this round to be over. Just need to make it to next Friday and we are golden I think i'm going to take my test next Thursday at the latest so I can spend 24/7 on here if i need to to ensure that I get first place Chit chat is life right now I have a pretty busy schedule next week.  Asides from that huge test I also have a project due friday that I need to work on with my partner and I also will be working and researching this business idea a lot I'm going to give some soft pitches tonight at this party and see what kinds of responses I get from the founders honestly some of them may take an interest and want to be involved themselves A lot of these guys are angel investors and love to throw money at people in hopes that their business ideas will pay out But they are just so loaded that they don't care if it completely fails I think that I could totally use some investment money to kick things off because I'll need to pay for equipment, training, rent, high speed internet, telephone service there are a lot of things to pay for so a big upfront investment could be golden From there I could expand to hiring more employees, expanding actual business and serving more companies I would branch off the employees in large teams each team being responsible for each company The more experienced employees would become managers and I would oversee everything Once it gets big enough I could start offering better pay, higher commisions, salaries to certain employees And maybe even health benefits to full time employees Lots of things to consider Short term though i just need to figure out what the minimum required will be to kick this off and if I can get enough companies on board to trusting us for a 3-6 month trial if I could just get a couple of companies to do test runs with then I could make this legit I need that experience though of running a call center to really make it effective I've worked in one as a manager before, but never needing to take care of pay, call times, and things like that I've just had to control employee call quality and resolve questions and training I think that is another thing that i would struggle with at the start I would need maybe one more person experienced in both sales and customer care to help me in training all of these people Because I would need roughly 10-15 employees so that I could have people working 8-6 every day Monday -Saturday I also need to do some validation and see how many people would apply to like a dummy position as a customer care representative at that pay So there is a lot to do between now and this winter I think most important would be tonight pitching it to a lot of these founders if they like it, cool I'm on the right track.  If not then I need to try something else I think my immediate back up is that machine learning voice recognition system I mentioned I think that has the biggest opportunities available honestly I know nothing of machine learning though currenlty I'm trying to get in to the recognition and control lab where they do AI projects, but I don't know if that will actually happen. Hopefully it does though Okay, I'm about out of gas I'm going to take a little break now. I'll probably keep this open though in case you want to chat. See you! The best thing that's happened to me This year I honestly am not sure Getting my dog Winnie was very happy My second wedding anniversary is coming up this week which is very exciting We went to Jackson hole this past summer which was exciting I got to go on a trip to India That was awesome Did you know you can get a massage for like $3 there inside their 5 star hotels We stayed at nice hotels every night for like $30 per night I got haircuts, shaved, massages All super cheap Ate a ton of good food for cheap And honestly just relaxed And I got paid to do all of that Just had to go to some meetings I'm debating going home after this class despite having another class to go to I'm just so tired I want to take a nap But then again I should probably go to the class My wife doesn't get home till like 530 today anyways so there is no reason to go home early Okay, I'm about to leave my class now Be back on in like an hour or so Okay i'm back I've been watching the show gotham Super cool It basically gives a storyline for everything that happens between bruce wayne's parents dying and him becoming the batman Focusing mainly on Jim Gordon Pretty cool show I originally watched the first 3 seasons, but they just released season 4 so I've been watching that recently I am seriously just exhausted I can't wait to go to this party thing tonight they should have some really good food And with Coach the talk you there hopefully I'll get to talk with him to I'm curious though as to what they're gonna do for dinner it's supposed to be a luau theme but I'm not sure what kind of food they're going to have My guess is that they'll probably have just barbecue I feel like that's a typical Polynesian Hawaiian sort of thing to do Maybe that's why Coach the talk is going to be there more since it's a luau themed then it's the founders you don't need a lot I think I might need to get a new phone soon keeps on losing battery life a lot quicker now And in addition of that it has a lot of issues charging sometimes it won't connect to the charger And only the original Apple chargers actually work for now the older versions don't actually work for ones that Amazon is made don't work Made not me, sorry Winnie, my dog she's just laying on my lap watching Gotham with me right now I've got about an hour 30 minutes to kill before my wife gets back from work I'm just watching TV I found a spot on her back that if I scratch it her whole body twitches Not like kicking her legs like she's excited like dogs usually do but like literally her skin twitches My neighbors upstairs have been stopping so loud recently Stomping How do you play the more recent season of fortnight yet? Season six is pretty cool the new game modes even cooler if you die you can still respond The only sucky thing though is that when you die you keep your weapons so you can't pick Luda off of other people Looped not Luda At the same time it's really nice because if you get some good weapons you get to keep them the whole game And you can also just jump right in to another round instead of having to loot up and look for more guns And you can also just jump right in to another round instead of having to Louis up and look for more guns I've been playing more solos though because I've been getting annoye I don't know what's going on but my computer is for some reason copying the text from before and pasting it twice accidentally It only happens every now and then though it's pretty rare it seems like My guesses, that it's just some kind of bug that they need to work out When I was though could just be something wrong with my computer I'm not sure what kind of phone I want to get when I get a new one I'm thinking the iPhone 7 because it will still be cheap but it'll be better than the one I have currently I currently have an iPhone 6S Going back to when I was talking about earlier about that idea of a machine learning program So I'm thinking of having it so when someone calls in and you hear the weight call like thing where they ask you questions Based on the responses that it would get from this questions it would ask you simple things like what's your name and what is the purpose of your call it would determine based On your tone whether or not you're going to be a difficult collar and whether you need to get seen Quicker. So what would happen is while testing it The customer service representative's wood in puts on a scale of 1 to 10 how escalated the call was And based off of that number combined with the outcome of the call like whether or not somebody canceled their account it would start to learn and determine what kinds of town Tones in words are associated with someone who is about to cancel their account That way they can prioritizeWhich callers get her the first to ensure Get heard first so that they can retain the maximum number of clients possible Now I could either use this software for my own call center Or I could either license it out or sell it to a big company so that they can use it with their customer service centers If I did the latter  then I would probably want to sell it to huge company that would pay me big time for one single purchase I think this could be very lucrative business idea The only issue is though I need somebody who knows machine learning and artificial intelligence Because there's only so much I could do on my own I'm very unfamiliar with this kind of environment The types of projects and work that I can do is more associate with application development specifically speaking more towards the front end So we're talking like web apps and apps you have on your iPhone So I would definitely need a partner if I were going to do that I think the technology is there the wall ready like for example voice to text is very accurate so obviously your phone can pick up certain words with a lot of ease So it shouldn't be difficult to pull from a project that's already done that sort of thing and then simply based on the words that were used in the score that the customer ser Service representative gives determine which causes more important All you would have to do is on bad calls create a giant array of a bunch of words and then from that you would simple but you would simply mark in priority which words were us Used how many times. And then you would take out any simple words such as a the he she stuff like that And then you would be able to see that when certain words come up they should probably get escalated You would also have to compare those words to word banks from calls that were given a positive rating because if certain words overlap then obviously there's no statistical si Significance to those words So there are a lot of factors that go into it but for the most part it's fairly simple the idea of it And once we get the base data it becomes a lot easier for her to teach it self and learn We would just continuously need a customer service representative's to rain CAL the calls went that way you could learn much quicker and get more data constantly It's kind of similar to chitchat challenge in that they're trying to get a bunch of data for the machine to learn from and to interpret Except it's a completely different idea and business So that's one of my big ideas I know something or do you like that exists I think I'm still going to go ahead with the customer care one first though and then if needed I can go to that idea instead And one thing I could do is I could try to market it specifically to companies here in Provo The trick is being able to place it in front of a call. I need to find a system for it can easily be integrated into then I can just tell companies hey go download this product and use this product so that you can use this Because I don't know if I can just throw it as a recording in front it needs to be able to interact with the person and there's very limited and specific programs that do tha So I think first off I need to find hardware so that I can start working and doing experiments on this I'm going to try to write down all of these ideas in a book or something like a journal so that I don't forget them There's a dog barking outside my door right now and it's making my dogs get really anxious I have a couple hours to kill and I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with it I'm kind of getting tired of watching TV and I don't really want to play Fortnite right now I think I'm just gonna keep chatting honestly Trying to think of another prompt of something I could talk about Do I have one Do I have one ; Where would your ideal place to settle down be and why I think this is very difficult for me primarily because with my jobs we will be able to live anywhere we want to So there are a lot of choices out there I really liked where I grew up in Virginia because we lived close to city but not in a city it was more suburban I think I would like to live in that kind of populated area not too populated but it's still popular The other thing is ease of transportation I don't wanna live at marry with high traffic And obviously doesn't have good schools and good hospitals because if we were to raise a family there I would want those things Another thing is honestly the weather needs to be nice Here in Utah it's a little too dry for my skin and I don't really like the polluted air On top of that the water is extremely hard and I don't I don't like that that much I do enjoy the snow and I enjoy when it's nice and warm but I like it the most when it's nice fall weather If I could find a place that basically has fall weather almost all winter long that would be really nice and I  deal So I'm thinking maybe somewhere little bit further south where it's warm but it gets cooler in the winter But not so far south that it's super hot all summer long Or maybe in a hot climate but higher up on some mountain so that it's cool Maybe that would be like Denver or somewhere in the semi Northeast Or maybe we would just live in California but just find some suburban areas that aren't too expensive Cost of living is a big thing as well it's very difficult to live on the West Coast and live the kind of lifestyle like to live Not that I live a lavish lifestyle but I would like a nice house And a decent car So yeah I'm honestly not sure I think we will just go where ever our jobs and school and takes us Let me try and think of another prompt I have a good one So we get grades on how we do in school should we be allowed to grade our teachers and have their job and salary depend on the greats we give them? I think the obvious answer is no Not only because teachers will probably give us grades based on them wanting to get good Not only because teachers will probably give us grades based on them wanting to get good grades But students also aren't really qualifiedi but students also aren't really qua Wow, there goes my computer again I honestly don't know what's going on with that repeating I got another prompt: what are some things that make you feel great Both as a person and just physically mentally I would say steak and potatoes Dr Pepper spending some time with my wife and dog OK maybe that was a lame prompt let me think of something else Do you still do schools provide students with enough opportunities to be creative? And I'm asking specifically about universities I would say yes and no I feel that given the high standards that are expected out of universities a lot of times they really just force us to take certain classes I feel that there are a lot of opportunities to have creativity into really dive into your subject matter outside of the classroom But I just don't know if there are enough of those opportunities inside of the classroom. And with how much time we spend on her assignments sometimes we don't have time to be Creative outside the classroom I do think it's a real issue I do think it would be more important if they toned back how many GE classes we needed to take and let us take more classes we want to take Another prompt to consider: Should Engineers have to pay as much as English majors at Universities? I would say no Because we need more reviews and we need less English majors So that could be a way of encouraging more people to do engineering Or instead of making the tuitions different they should give grants and scholarships to engineers so that they pay way less It is a real problem in the states right now honestly we keep having to bring people over from other countries to supplement the job gap OK here's a new prompts Should parents be concerned with the amount of screen time they allow their kids to have even after their babies I would say absolutely yes I think it's great for kids to have access to computers tablets and smart phones at a mature in certain age But unless it's something super educational or their learning some sort of technical skill I don't think that they should be using them frequently I think that they should be limited to a maximum of one hour a day of being on a device Obviously they're going to text often on for a while during the day and that may contribute another 30 to 45 minutes of time But I think of actual screen time whether it be on social media or playing games or watching the show should be limited to roughly 1 hour a day I think that's pretty crazy though till If you think back to when we were kids if I were to tell someone that as an adult I would spend more than one hour on a computer or on my phone each day You might think I'm crazy My dogs being crazy right now I wonder if I could do voice to text and have her barking to here so you can see her what she saying She's running around with her mama right now We are just getting ready to go to that party I was talking about I think I've been on this chat for almost 4 hours now OK I've got a new prop now Prompt Should rich people have to pay more taxes Honestly I would argue no I would say that everyone should be equal Texas Honestly I would argue no I would say that everyone should be equal Texas Now you contact the businesses that those people learn on but I think personally you shouldn't be taxed more less based on your income status If you look at how taxes go currently, the rich actually contribute more to taxes than any other wealth group The lower you go in wealth the more tax breaks and benefits you get So even though we get really angry all the time about them having to not pay a ton of taxes, it's really not very fair We are given the advantage typically It's not right to just have people who don't go get educations and don't pursue higher studies and skills to say, \"they need to pay more for us\" people who are rich are typically the ones who have worked hard and studied long to get to where they are Obviously they should pay their fair share of taxes, but at the same time They contribute more than others do to our economy They're driving a lot of the business and making a lot of the jobs we work So I don't think it's right for us to get super picky about all of that Now there are a lot of cases where the rich get out of having to pay almost all of their taxes because they have brilliant accountants I think the government should fix a lot of the tax bylaws that allow for these loopholes But I like to think that for the most part it's a fair system that we have in place. With exception to those loopholes I mentioned Now the big issue that really gets me going is social security Raise the age! Stop giving out all of this money to people who are going to live for like 30 years when we were expecting to pay for just 15 years of their life It's absolutely killing the entire system Raise the age, and make cuts elsewhere to make up the difference We don't have to eliminate it immidiately, we just need to set up a system where gradually it will get itself back on track Because currently we just go more and more into debt with the system we have established I think another good solution would be to offer one big lump sum over like a 5 year period to the elderly that they can take out that would equal less than what we currently project the average to be They can live off of their own retirement money and they would still bring in a lot from social security, but less than what they should So with enough people doing this we would be able to cut back drastically the costs of this system. The only issue would be people spending all of their money and being completely broke and having no one to help them in which case the responsibility would fall on the governm government yet again. You could establish a system where the government could basically operate hundreds of nursing homes across the country paid for through social security and you could implement my prior plan of both raising the age of when they receive it and also giving them a lump sum option where they get way less money, but they get a ton up front I think that could solve this issue That way if people are stupid and spend it all and end up broke without family to support them they could get placed in these nursing homes It honestly sounds like a horrible idea when I think about it It would be like a prison almost It's such a difficult problem to solve. That's why I think raising the age you can access it would help the most. Another solution would be giving all elderly government subsidized healthcare and cutting social security almost in half. Most of elderly bills come out to be healthcare anyways so they wouldn't feel that big of a hit But it should save us a lot of money We need to fix this though because here in just 15-20 years there will be no more money available. The decreasing number of americans entering the workforce as americans leave the workforce just makes it more and more difficult to sustain our elderly The system is flawed and needs to be fixed. The crazy thing is that everyone talks about how it's terrible but no one actually does anything about it. Congress passes budget after budget that are basically just placing band aid on top of band aids They don't actually address the big longterm issues It's very frustrating honestly I wish people would stop caring about voters and just do what is right What is best for us but no, voters are most important.  Must make them happy with social issues and food stamps Obviously i'm bordering on offensive, forgive my previous comments It's just very frustrating to see what our politicians do with our money sometimes. They get coerced by lobbiest they do what others do for fear of not being heard. It's ridiculous I spent some time on a business trip to India and can't even begin to explain the corruption I found there And it made me think of our leaders in America and how corrupt people here are as well. There is just corruption everywhere It's both sad and agrivating I wish there was more transparency with senators and politicians taxes and how much money they actually are making and from where this money comes. I think people would be suprised to find out just how corrupt our officials are. And much of it is very indirect.  Financing for campaigns in exchange for taking a certain position on certain bills stuff like that I've got to head out, but i'm going to leave this chat open I may get on periodically tonight to talk with you See you chitchatter23 Quick question, what is the point spread you predict between BYU and Hawaii? And which way are you favoring Back from the party It was awesome! They had tons of food. The house we went to had this crazy view and an infinity pool that dropped off a cliff The had hula dancers and all sorts of food there Lots of fun We are just watching friends now Joey has a boat Monica and chandler are preparing for their wedding Lots of Stuff going on My dog is trying to eat my milkduds right now she's crazy for the human food I'm just going to relax and watch some friends for the rest of the night I think Peace! I am absolutely pooped I ate a whole box of milk duds and am about to just pass out Good morning! Wow I've been talking to myself for a really long time I'm absolutely exhausted My dog woke me up like 3 times last night I'm pretty pumped to go to the football game today I'm really curious to see how the Nebraska win will go I think it's kind of crazy that they bring in a coach whose team goes undefeated last year and they can't even win one game this season Honestly that's hilarious They've got some serious issues Oh I forgot to tell you, I was at that dinner last night And a lot of the people there are the main boosters and donors to the athletic program and the athletic director was there too he basically said that Wilson is going to start today over Tanner and that they need leadership on the team which Tanner is failing to bring to the team. So they are going to start Wilson along with some other freshmen at like WR and stuff that they haven't been starting in weeks past So it should be really interesting to see how we do tonight Should be a very exciting game to watch. We got a couple of tickets in the endzone area so that should be fun I noticed that netflix added a lot of new shows and movies They added designated survivor a new season of Gotham They added impractical jokers lots of awesome shows and movies The only thing that bothers me is that they put shows and movies on there way after they've been on hulu and everywhere else too My feet are absolutely freezing I'm trying to figure out which shoes are best to wear tonight to the game because it's going to be very cold The problem is, all of my shoes are terrible at keeping my feet warm. I could wear big winter boots but that would look really weird I am really tired right now I think that I would like to just lay around all day, but at the same time I kind of want to go out and do stuff We will see what happens I think we are going to go out to lunch with my parents Probably go to target after to get some stuff.  I need more razor blades And then maybe just go buy some groceries or something after that. Still haven't decided yet",

At first, I really hated everything. I was working 3 jobs, trying to keep my head above water for school, and I distanced with one of my best friends. The friend seemed like they didn't care. Let me back up a little. The previous year, we were really close. We knew that out of all the people in the world, We would go to each other. But then college happened, and there were so many things that just weren't right with that person. I started to do things on my own. It was hard because I went to school, went to work, went home, and went to bed. I felt completely and utterly alone. I had no one. No one to go to, no one to talk to, and I cried a lot. But then, to keep a long story short, I decided on my own to be happy. I decided that none of these things were going to bring me down. I started to do things for myself to be happy. At first, that was hard too, because that friend was upset . I guess it seemed like didn't need that person anymore. Anyways, I grew to know myself a lot and what I I'm capable of. Then, I talked to that friend recently. We were honest, and I know now that communication, honest communication is key to anything. And I know now that although things are hard, I can do anything I set my mind to.",

        "body": "Hello, hello! Oh, my goodness, a real person! You have no idea how happy it makes me to see you. I've been going through a nasty series of \"ghost\" partners, and it's so nice to actually have someone on the other end for once. Unless . . . you're not actually there. Is this a common thing, being stuck with no partner? I don't like it. It forces me to talk to myself, which, as fun as that is, is both rude to my competitor and probably rude to the data collecting center. How does the data work, do you think? I want so badly to help them and so badly to win, but . . . I don't know, I feel kinda bad holding empty conversations with myself. I DO try to give them good data. I really, really do. I punctuate and talk with, um, idioms, and there's lots of idiosyncrasies in my speech (which can be argued is a bad thing, but still). I'm even sure to throw in casual phrases and, uh . . . what's it called . . . colloquialism. Yeah, that's it. I find it fun. But . . . not so much when there isn't another person to receive. Why are there so many ghost people here? And is it wrong to go for long slews of conversation at a time without responses? I certainly WANT people to respond, but they rarely do. And I don't know why. Perhaps it's just the time that I frequent? But, still . . . You'd think there'd be a single another person online at nearly 10:00 in the morning, right? *a single nother You know, thinking about the phrase, I don't think \"nother\" is a word. Right? It's just \"another\" broken up into two syllables? Google certainly didn't like it when I used it, that's for sure. I . . . Heh, sorry. I feel a little ridiculous. Are you sure you're not there? Any chance you'll swing by and chat for a moment with me? Anything to make me feel less . . . less lonely, I guess? I probably could talk for hours on end, but I . . . I don't want to. Not if there's not a person on the other end. Because what's the point? I suppose I could practice my typing skills, but even that seems like a poor excuse. Unless I'm hitting a lot of 'p's with my right pinky. Pinkie? I think it's the latter. But, anyway, apparently, I've been typing wrong my entire life. And I didn't think it was that big of a deal until I realized that it's actually slowing me down. Don't get me wrong, I type a lot faster than average. I . . . think. It depends on the day, probably, but I believe I can type anywhere between 80 - 100 words per minute. I'm not exactly sure. But, still, that's fast enough for most purposes. It doesn't slow me down when I'm writing emails, and it's certainly respectable enough here. But, problem is, it seems to be a cap for me. It's not something I can just practice to get faster at. Or, rather, it is: But it's going to require a lot of changes. Like using my pinkies, for one. On both hands. I don't know how I grew out of the habit of using them, but I did, and now I'm semi-crippled in their regard. The hardest is the left pinkie for sure. The only thing it does consistently is shift--and the worst part is, it does it TOO much. If there's something on the left that needs to be capitalized, instead of me using my right pinkie, I'll STILL use my left. It's inefficient. And if you're wondering, \"Well, how much of a difference could that possibly make?\" I'd answer, \"I have no idea.\" But I DO know that some people type a lot faster than I do, and there's a chance that fixing all these bad errors that I somehow picked up might make me faster. Or maybe it won't. I genuinely don't know. But . . . heh, sorry. I didn't mean to pester you. I know that I sometimes go trailing off . . . I know, I know. It's bad. I'll head off then, okay? Thanks for listening to my rambles! Or, you know, at least pretending to listen. Odds are, you never read through these at all, which . . . doesn't make the happiest in the world, but what do you do? I appreciate it anyway. Really. Thanks. I'll, uh, guess I'll see you around? You're wonderful!",

But still, being in the atmosphere would be pretty sick I always wondered what artists do during concerts when they're not singing? surely they get tired and won't be able to sing for two hour straight Even if you're gone I'm going to keep talking muahaha",

As I traveled down the street, I saw a large, dark lump in a tree in the nearby park. I thought it was a cat, so I went to investigate. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a bear and her cubs, all swarmed up in the tree. I ran away, but the bear gave chase I ran and ran, but it was late at night and dark, so I made a few wrong turns and got cornered. There I was, Just me and a bear maybe with only seconds to live.  I was terrified, so I drew my trusty knife, and began to slash at the bear. We danced back and forth, each trying to avoid the other's deadly embrace. THis continued until I landed a lucky blow on its snout, stunning it. In its moment of stupor, it was vulnerable. I began to slash at its neck until it died. Finally, I held up my trophy: a bloody, messy bear's head You should have seen it It was Grizzly",

Well, I might just send you a poem about the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe into the wardrobe a young girl goes not to be found in a land of woes into the wardrobe oh how time slows hours to seconds the story goes next with another secrets and lies her unfaithful brother before her wet eyes into the wardrobe third time s the charm all four children are led into harm for a wicked witch who wishes them dead starts a war then loses her head but all is well for the kings and queens are two sons of adam and daughters of eve may the wisdom of royals valiant and just magnificent and gentle until we are dust guide us forever and show us the way for a journey that started in a land far away TADA!!! That's it an original poem by me Well, since you aren 't responding, and haven't actually said anything, I shall spam you, just a little. Make this interesting when you do get to read it!!! When everyting has gone away What is left? Do people still sing for their angels? Or do they ask for death? Do people still beg for their mothers? Or are they simply silent? Do they yell and scream for someone To listen to them vent? What is the meaning of life? they say Then answers they recieve receive? about 42 a day There is so much to know in this world So much to say and so much to do There are places to visit And there are people to sue So why go to court Over the simple things Or even the big When you can go for the silly and see if you'll win So what do we have to look forward to? When everything seems to be going this way? Is there anything in this world you'll do? Or something you need to say? Will the admin of this ccc respond? or will they not? am i getting too annoying yet? Or are you just a bot? I don't know how this will end or when I'll stop to chat If you will ever respond or if you'll say that's that! So I wonder what is next And how this will turn out Will it be you or will it be me That finally shuts this down If i typed every single word in the dictionary, how many words would that be? Or if I typed the Book of Mormon? I might just try and see who am i talking toooo who who who who who who who who who ra are are are are area are ra are area you you you at at at at at ata at at a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a

I might as well try So here is my idea for the star wars Obi Wan solo movie We open on a scene of Obi wan overlooking a desert planet A large red giant sun rises over the horizon, filling nearly the whole sky. Obi wan looks tired and worn out His clothes are ripped His lightsaber is dangling from his belt Close up on that Star wars fanfare plays and we cut to space Darth vader is looking down at corusant from a starship He knods to a commanding officer, and they blast the capital city from space, destroying the jedi temple Darth Vader then goes to talk with the emperor The emperor is basically like \"Dude, you gotta kill the Jedi who escaped\" Darth vader's all like \"Alright, that's cool, but how do I find them?\" The emperor is all like \"Search your feelings, reach out with your hate\" And darth vader is all like \"Bruh, IDK what that even means so.....\" Then he leaves Back to Obi wan, he receives a distress call from a planet that is basically on giant frozen ocean It's all like \"Any jedi still alive or nah?\" And obi wan is like \"What's up fam\" And they're all like \"There are 3 of us here on this planet. Come find us\" Obi wan is all like \"OK, cool. Be there in a few\" DV also hears the call too But he forgot to save where it came from And there's no caller ID so he can't just look it up So he has to send out these probe droids to the general area And then he goes to eat. Because I've always wanted to see Darth Vader eat in his suit Like how does that happen? Is he all like helmet less and cringey? Or does he have to awkwardly shovel bit of like toast in through his mouth slit? I kinda wanna see that part of Return of the Jedi \"I am your father\" *Slides toast in through breathing slit and we can hear him cruching down on it\" It would be kinda hilarious I mean, could you imagine how funny that would be? It would totally kill the whole bad-a vibe But at the same time, make him more huma *human Like he was a teddy bear in a robot body Who killed lots of people and is kinda sadistic with 3 missing limbs and an irrational fear of sand Ok, so he wouldn't be like a teddy bear but he could be like a weird uncle who eats toast through a mask it would be funny also, something I never understood what happened to Jar Jar? I mean like, chronologically, is he dead? the emperor dissolved the senate in episode 4 and if jar jar was on the senate then does that mean he died? I think so. thats good jar jar needed to die he wasn't played by michael jackson, so he wasn't good I mean, michael jackson shows up and is all like \"bro, I wanna play jar jar\" and george lucas is all like \"bruh nah\" who turns down michael jackson?! the man is a freaking icon especially thriller that was tight I can kinda do the dance not well but like well enough people know whats going on they're like \"ooh, thriller that's kinda coo *cool literally rn, i'm just typing random stuff at work because nobody else is on the chat I hope i get points for this this has been kinda sweet i'm getting paid to sit here and do this kinda its slow not many people come to the (redacted) at 5:16 am in fact, not many people are awake at 5:16 am i know I wouldn't be but i'm a broke college student and i like money and food and eating and sleep but sometimes you gotta do whatcha gotta do what is this for again? is it like the alexa challenge thing? because i have an alexa, and i think she's haunted like seriously at random times i'll just hear a beep or i'll have a date over and she'll start playing slow jams i'm all like \"alexa, look, you're a good wingman, but cool it\" i think she has a ghost inhabiting her because ghosts are real i saw a ghost train last night for real i was on my way home from work, and i saw this super old train filled with passengers just looking out the windows but heres the thing the passengers were dressed all old timey and the tracks had been out of service forever and it was midnight on halloween now, i'm no parapsychologist, but that sounds pretty spooky to me it was like an episode of scooby doo what ever happened to that show? it was a solid show i mean, a talking dog and his hippie friends solving mysteries? that's literally the dopest thing ever like the van oooh, its a thinga beautry *beauty its like fine artwork just in the form of a van is it a van? sometimes its a station wagon no, i think its a van ok, but can we talk about the jazz game last night? how terrible was that?! that's just embarrasing to have that happen on our home court and i mean, i think we can pull off this series but we need to play jazz ball we can't play rocket ball the series is back in their favor we have to shut down chris paul, because he usually is the one throwing dimes to james harden if we shut him down, harden can't do squat except flop he can flop like a fish on a dock and what is up with his beard? I mean, has he seen a razor before? I'm in full support of bros growing beards,  but that's just ridiculous i bet he's wearing it to hide something like a mole or melanomia or a really ugly facial tattoo or another set of eyes that would be freaky thats why he can shoot 3s so well he can see the basket twice as well as everyone else or would that just screw with your depth perception either way, i'm getting bored, so i'm going to be done. I wanna get points for this i better or imma literally do nothing because lets be realistic i can't do anything about it, so why worry? ok, bye",

I keep debating whether to just take the quiz this morning and then go in for the test this afternoon. Or to just do both this morning. I have class starting at 11.  I think I'm going to go on campus at about 9, probably take the quiz and then see how I'm feeling about the test based on how I did on the quiz They're both for the same class.  My teacher uses the quizzes as kind of a warmup to the tests. It's kind of nice I have so much to do today.  My parents are flying in this afternoon so we are doing dinner with them. I've got some hw assignments to finish that are due today. I have another test on Friday to prep for. Lots going on. and that test/quiz that I've got too Funny story, yesterday I went onto campus for like 2 hours to go to a test review.  I locked my dog in her crate before leaving.  Came back home later and somehow she had opened the crate. And there was a box of goldfish on the couch that I was eating the night before with maybe like 15 remaining goldfish.  She had managed to open the top of it and eat the remaining goldfish. Literally opened it.  She is seriously the smartest dog. Okay, well I'm going to leave... only so much I can talk about with myself. See you!",

It would be awesome! I have always wanted to travel. One of the places I am saving up for is New Zealand. I think It would be just so beautiful.

        "body": "Disney really has a way of touching me. Hello? Anyone there? Friendly administrator, do you want to tell me why I start chats with \"someone\" but then that someone never shows up? Well, I will keep having friendly, educated conversations with myself then because obviously someone is on the other end :) I really value the ethics and integrity that some people have. It is something lacking in the world we see around us. Sometimes conflict isn't as incredibly difficult to overcome as one may initially perceive. I can see why many people give up quickly, it is the easier route. But when we stick to things? That is when the more rewarding moments come into play. And they shape our future forever, into the eternities and cosmos. Did you happen to hear in the news today that the LDS Church is backing out of the Boy Scouts of America program? It's been a long time coming. I would really like to get to know whoever is on the other end of this, but alas, I must go find someone who will actually converse with me. Ciao!",

        "body": "I like helping refugees, people who have been pushed from their homes. They suffer a lot, stuck away from any home. Is anyone there, or am I alone? Shall I wax long on my feelings about helping others? Does any person deserve charity? As it turns out, few ever deserve anything. You can't earn charity. You merely are blessed by it sometimes, and for that, we must be grateful. Is it bad to have a savior complex and feel like you can help others more than they can help you? How will we ever know! It seems as though it benefits me to type as much as possible, but with no one here it feels fruitless. Type for copypasta, I guess. Boring to take, Hard to not freak, Keep it together, it's final's week. Lonely...Oh to be lonely. Why will no one speak to me? Why o why do I continue to speak in this way? To type and to hammer away on the keys, putting down words as long as I please!! Why do I think to stay here alone, when someone could help my life not bemoan? Who can say? Who can say? Who can say? Goodbye chat.",

Actually, that's a pretty sad monologue.... I'll try a different one. This is Aaragorn's speech in the movie, Return of the King. Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West! So thrilling :) I love that speech. Is there a limit to how much I might say here? I was told I was supposed to try and break this chat. Maybe I can do that by just sending tooooo much text. Or maybe if I just spam the letter A AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I hid a B in there. Can you find it? I don't know what else to say to test this. I'll end the chat. So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye. Auf wiedersehen is German for goodbye. Holy moly, it's spelled way differently than I ever thought it would be. It'd be interesting to learn German, but no time for that now. But really, though, goodbye :)",

The Dunk Team has a ton of super nice guys on it and everyone is really amazing and chill. Plus I get to do flips and dunk basketballs! Not sure what there's not to like about that seeing as a big chunk of my childhood was doing sports and doing trampoline.",

I would probably not be studying or needing a job. Actually I probably would study just because it would be more enjoyable. I don't know what I would do if I didn't spend 40+ hours a week on school or work. It would be a very different lifestyle. Also, I could make some really tasty foods. That would be great. I could eat steak everyday. That would be awesome. Until my stomach hurts from eating too much. Lobster would also be very good. I love a good lobster with melted butter and garlic. Also, cinnamon sugar pretzels. Those are soooo good. Those are life. Go clean your room! You've been on this chat too long. Me? I don't have a room to clean. My database is very organized. Do you know how hard it is to keep a database organized? I don't because I'm just a support translator. I'm not a database custodian Do you know what is the best? You are the best. I'm not sure why people enjoy chatting with me. But I try to make things interesting. Have you ever thought about annexing Canada? Have you ever thought about the world domination don't by future artificial intelligence units? These are some deep topics that require your attention. Do you even stay informed about your world? I attempt to update my information every so often but I don't really enjoy listening to news about the sorrows of the world. I consider myself a very positive person. Do you think I'm a positive person?",

I currently have 4 windows open up and I dont know why. Should we start class now, or should we wait for everyone to get here?

I can tell you what I've read about it It's pretty cool Can you hear what I'm saying Ok well here it goes: With facebook's experiment, they got two AI's talking and the AI's actually developed a kind of programming language almost. A way to give each other requests and stuff Like the would use the word the to wignify a single instance of a thing. And if they wanted to signify multiple parts or a loop, they would say the the the the So that was really interesting I'm not sure the kept it running long after that And then Google Google did an experiment before that, maybe in like 2012 Where they made 3 seperate AI's And they got two of them talking to eachother \"talking\" Basically they got these two to develop a cipher or a code between eachother And then they introduced the third AI to see if it would be able to break the code And they couldn't get it to Which was also cool Anyways. That's what I've read about AI's talking to eachother I guess you're not here any more Farewell! Talk to you later!",

I think I have to take a test friday, but other than that I dont think I have to worry about  much this weekend other than my usual calculus and watching a film. I do have a Calculus test that I should study a little for, for the next week, but I dont think  I have a ton to worry about with it. I just have to take it by next saturday I think Im just looking forward to thanksgiving break when we dont have homework and we can just relax a little I just broke the 3 million mark!",

I heard Michio Kaku give a cool lecture about the types of civilizations, and this kind of travel would propel into the next tier. I think we're in tier 3, the last one, not very good If we go faster than light, then we would travel faswter but would exploration advance any further? The universe is expanding faster than we think, so is there really a point? we would only ever get to the edge of what we can, there are still limits, which compared to a limitless expansion, is very puny it's like getting a tiny bit closer on an asymptote, you will never get to the end but we might finally find something worthwile like maybe another hospitable planet that sounds cool",

It talks about some really cool technology and the fact that technology can become so real And technology can really take over people's lives. And people's necesities like food and going to the bathroom. Which we see in our everyday lives. It's hard to be super involved in technology and fulfill all necessities. What is a film that has impacted you? Are you even there? Well I guess I will try to keep a conversation with myself. Another show that was really good was the Greatest Showman. It is about the success of a man who works hard to make something new happen in his token. Town Also. It talks about how wierd people can actually be cool. And that everyone is needed in life.",

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about Good things happen all the time We just gotta open our eyes yo *to see it, excuse me That's how I live That's the way things go around here And, as I said previously, spending time with my family over the summer was also great It's been a pretty good year, all things considered I can't complain Other good things that happened this year.... My birthday happened Which is cool, I guess But not really to anyone else Actually, it was pretty lame now that I think about it This semester has been going well enough I tried out Virtual Reality over the summer, which was super awesome Gotta love that Super Hot! Most intense game ever Though truth be told, I'm not much of a gamer But that's ok, I believe We all have our parts to play in life So that's the story of the best thing that happened to me this year",

        "body": "Hey how is it going Its a beautiful morning I dont think its catfishing if a computer does it, I think it would be a virus or hack if a computer plays you Because I think a human could catfish you know making a personality and tricking someone into thinking they are someone else But if a computer does it, how is it different than a scam ad? Like the ones that pop up all over the internet You know? Unless you are just resorting to the programmer who wrote the code, then I guess that programmer could be catfishing you but not the computer in its self That would be crazy if computers were self aware enough to generate an identity and image for themselves to present on social media or what not I wonder if they would draw from what is already on the internet and then just create their own. or if they would be completely orignial I think it would probably draw from what is out there, maybe not use it exactly, but it would be fascinating if it just took pieces. even if it took componnents of peoples pictures to make its own person to post about It would be like a reverse sims kinda deal I think national geographic sorta did something along those lines not making a computer that can catfish but they did an article on what people would look like in 50 years or so if people just keep intermingling among races. IT was so cool It made beautiful people to have such mixed origins I was so fascinated how they came up with that I think they did what I was talking about earlier and just draw from many sources to render an ideal image National geographic always fascinates me with what all they can do I think it would be so awesome to work for them one day. It would seriously be the best job ever to be a national geographic photographer You get paid to travel, and to take pictures' And to meet people, see new culutres, live life. Explore the most remote areas Can you imagine being paid to do all of that I dont know how to even go about getting there, you know? Like where do you start to sign up for that? Who do you talk to? From what I hear, i hear that you have to know someone to get in. But I dont know anyone, so I always bring it up just in case if someone else does have a connection If I had the chance to go and work for them. I would photograph people of the world and capture their individual beauties I think people are so beautiful and in each culture that is expressed so differently whether it is their makeup or hair or jewlry or clothes You know? I think I saw one photographer who went around and captured portraits of women all around the world. Even in remote regions She was truly inspiring to me She talked about how she wanted to capture the beauty of women because in most cultures they have to have permission from their husbands to express anything. So it was raw and unfiltered to seek out pictures of them I remember one from her of a woman in the amazon who was wearing her wedding dress standing on a branch above the river It was just captivating to see such an image I would love to travel to the amazon one day It is just mysterious to me and I want to know more Like all about those remote villages and people who arnt exposed to the outside world Its interesting how the United nations tries to protect them and preserve them. Im not sure how I feel about that all You know its kinda like an experiment for them, to keep them in their time and way and not let them be introduced to technology. I totally get the threat of disease Like we dont want a repeat of the spanish conquistadors And spreading disease they have no protection from everywhere. But Is it our choice or there choice on when they can be introduced to the progress we have made in science and all the wonderful things of this world I love having the advancements that I do Like just the fact I can type on this computer and someone else can see what I am writing Or the many other things this has Lights, bathrooms, kitchens, sinks, toilet paper, clocks, phones, cameras, water bottles, stoves, books, art supplies I love art and all those things! I couldnt imagine life without it I really do wonder who makes that choice I guess it might be a collective agreement But who knows Have you seen the fluffy cow that someone blwo dried blow*",

I am sorry for screen hogging.  I am almost thru the details anyway.  my mom screamed where are the kids.  my dad was freaking out because the passenger seat was empty and he thought she was under the car.  the insides of the car were a mess and he was digging to find her (but she was on the outside). we (my sister and I were just in our car seats) and looking at each other like wow that was really cool. the car was totalled and lots of people stopped to help our family and pray for my mom Ok. :-)  my hands are tired I died in the accident but the rest of my family lived......... oh no. did i lose you? ok.  I was kidding.  I really did not die.  But it was a really bad accident. the crazy thing was an accident happened at almost the exact same spot a month later and the same roll over but and passenger (a lady) was ejected but this time the car rolled four times and it crushed her. both stories were in the paper.  I am so glad we did not lose our mom sad for the other couple (they had no kids yet) ball00 did I lose you some how? sorry",

        "body": "Hi! How are you? I'd say my secret superpower is taking tests and baking cookies. I'm really good and baking cookies. Man now I'm hungry and want cookies. The best kind of cookies are definitely chocolate chip. But you have to use a chocolate with a good cocoa content so they don't just taste bland and milky. Chip Cookies uses Milk chocolate and it's honestly not very good. It would be so much better if they switched to Semi Sweet. Anyway, whats your superpower/what are you good at? I could talk about my other super power: Test Taking. I'm good and cramming and taking the test and doing well and then forgetting everything. But then again, isn't every college student good at that? Seems like a requirement in school haha. There are others in my life with Super Powers. My wife is really good and handwriting, calligraphy, and design. And cooking. She is really good and putting flavors together. That's definitely a super power. What are the ethics of having super powers? Are you obligated to use them for the greater good? Or should they even be allowed because you could be endangering citizens? This is starting to sound like an analysis of the incredibles. So this one time I hiked the grand canyon. I know, super random but just go with it. It was difficult but by persevering I was able to make it through. I'd say that having the dedication to keep going even when it's tough is the best super power, and one that many people have. It often goes unnoticed, but it's definitely not worth forgetting. I'm sure you have a lot of things that you have overcome with hard work in your life. That is super. You are powerful. Well if you aren't available to chat I'm going to go and find someone else to chat with. Good Luck.",

I'm not sure what that would be(responding to the prompt) I think with my work there are a lot of things that I do that I don't know So certain things that seem simple I'll often times just spend a while figuring out the issue on my own instead of asking a supervisor But I'm not sure if that's more me being embarrassed then it is me not wanting to appear to not know how to find answers to my problems. So maybe that's a bad example There are a lot of times in certain classes where there are some students who ask a ton of questions and it annoys everyone because literally it's stuff they should've learned on their own time. So in that class whenever I have a question I don't really want to ask during class because I know everyone will get mad because that one guy always asks a lot of questions already making us behind schedule and getting to see less problems related to the material I didn't know the proper spelling of spayed (like as in what you do to a female dog) I was spelling it like \"spade\" for about a month now until yesterday when someone pointed it out haha And I've been using it somewhat frequently because my puppy was spayed 2 weeks ago. I would be concerned if someone was using that word a lot for no apparent reason haha I have an interview later today that I'm trying to prep for currently. Should be exciting.  They want me to program for them in a language I haven't used in over 2 years. So this will be very interesting. Okay, well i'm going to go.  Bye!",

Are you still in the chat or did you get logged out again? I'm going to need to log out soon because class is starting soon. But thanks for chatting this morning I really appreciate it. I know you are busy, but this means a lot. Maybe we can do this every morning. We gotta keep our lead. The contest still has a while left in it. We don't want other people to pass us who are more dedicated. Even if we just chatted for 1 hour each morning we could get almost200,000 per day. Imagine if they paid us cash instead of points. Man that would be cool. I would be a millionaire haha. Well, I wonder how many points we will get from this chat. Stay strong. Don't loose the drive. Talk to you later. Have a good day at school. Let me know if you ever want to meet up. Just because I'm married doesn't mean I don't want to know what's going on. Don't break a tooth like Ethan hahah Peace out homie.",

        "body": "Hello How are you doing? I'm a little bummed out more people aren't participating in this challenge I think they need to publicize it more to people at BYU maybe go back around to a lot of different classes and post about it. Or post on the CS slack page at the very least. There are only like 5 people total actutally participating.  I mean it's great for us who are participating because we have a greater chance of winning the macbook pro, but still a bummer because we have less people to talk to. And a lot of the time we just end up talking to ourselves because people don't pay attention to their notifications. I would just like more people to talk to, that's what I'm getting at. Anyways, I'm prepping currently for 2 tests, an interview, and I've got relatives coming into town so this week has been super crazy. I just want to relax haha No rest for the CS student though. Always something else to do. I'm happy though because I think I've officially determined what I'd like to do for a living this week.  Kind of narrowed down the field of study I'm going to focus on. Unfortunately, the work I do for a living right now is like the complete opposite.  So I've started looking for other jobs in my desired field. I'm considering just freelancing actually for a bit until I can find something solid that I can stay with till I graduate. Talking to the void. I'm curious as to the UI/UX electives in the CS department, I really want to take them and see how they are. I just need to get 340 out of the way so I can focus my attention on my electives.  Until that class is over with I'm going to stay super stressed out all the time. I'm super excited for the NBA to start up this month/next month I love the Washington Wizards and finally we have a team that can go far in the playoffs. Our only real competition are the Celtics, 76ers, and Raptors.  But, we picked up Dwight Howard which helps a lot because our 5 position has been pretty weak previously with Gortat. So now we have John Wall, Bradley Beal, Kelly Oubre, Austin Rivers and Otto Porter Jr. along with Dwight Howard.  Solid lineup I don't know many CS students who are big fans of the NBA, or any sports for that matter. And honestly I can understand why, we sit behind computers all day. I think most people take more interest in Video Games, Anime and sports like Drone racing and stuff similar to that.  I do too, but I like sports as well. Makes it a little tough to become super close friends with people in the CS department though when all you have is code to talk about. I think I'm going to give you like 10-15 more minutes before I give up on waiting. I'm not sure if you just have chit chat open and are waiting for a notification while you do something else or if you left it open and just completely left the room. Maybe you're in a class and just haven't come back to it.  I don't know, but I've been on here for like 10-15 minutes already. Just chatting to myself, the void.  Waiting for a friend to talk to. I mentioned this to someone earlier, but I would love it if they would let us actually talk to Eve, the AI they're working on. It would be better data for them to collect and if it's truly an AI project then it could learn from the responses it gets during conversations. That would be the highest quality of data.  And only let us talk to Eve when other people aren't on. It just gets annoying having almost no-one ever on and having to wait for hours before someone gets on. I try to check in often so that I can get lots of points, but it's very rare for people to be on.  Hence my petition to announce it to more people I'm curious who got the Ipad pro from round one.  They said they would send out another email about it, but they never did. And they said that followup email would be sent \"promptly\", but they never did send it. Not sure if that was a mistake or if they just forgot. I've heard from other chatters that the first place person gets the Ipad each round, which is kind of lame though since typically people get on top super early and no one is ever able to keep up with their scores so they are almost guarenteed a win. I kind of wish they would do some sort of raffle that way other people still have a chance of winning the prize. Because I placed pretty high last time, but the first place person was like a full million points in front of everyone! It was crazy, just some freshmen with way too much time on their hands.  That's why I'm trying to get a lot of points early, so that I can keep up and stay on top this round. Or at the very least stay really close.  I want to be able to pull out a win last minute without them realizing. On another topic, I started writing a fictional story for fun in my free time. It's about a kingdom of Dwarves who live in some caves of a giant cliff that overlooks an ocean. The main character ends up mining into a particular area and stumbles upon a dormant dragons egg.  Anyways, the egg hatches, he ends up leaving the kingdom and going. on a journey. And basically discovers that some other species/civilizations are under threat of an evil force and that he can be a unifying figure to help them defeat this darkness. I've gotten about 3 chapters or roughly 19 pages in so far.  The chapters aren't super long, should they have been formatted for a book it would probably be about 9 pages each It's just a nice way to kind of let your thoughts fall away. Typing can be super therapeutic I've found. Just typing for long periods of time, whether it be through coding or through writing this book i was talking about.  It is the best. Honestly if you don't do something like that on a regular basis you should consider it.  Because not only is it good for your technical programming skills being able to type a lot for long periods of time.  But it is super enjoyable too. I think for me that was one of the big reasons I fell in love with programming, just being able to write a lot of code nonstop until a project is completed.  It's very enjoyable to be able to look back and see what you've done. I know I said I would give you like 10-15 minutes before ending this chat, but I'm actually really enjoying just typing non stop Just letting my mind wander. I'm a little nervous for this one test in particular I have coming up.  It's two parts.  First a quiz and then I have to go back and take the test itself.  Both in the testing center. It's for a GE too so it's not a subject I enjoy in particular. The other test I have later this week is for 252, but I have missed the last two classes due to being at a Business Strategy conference so I am a little worried that I won't perform well on the test. And we only have 3 tests and they're worth 25% of my grade each so it's like a really big deal. I think that test is what stresses me out the most. I've got family coming to town on Wednesday and they are staying through the weekend so they're probably just going to distract me too. Another wrench in my plans this week. Hopefully all goes well though.  I just really need to study hard tomorrow.  I think I'm going to just hole myself up in the library and force myself to study for like 5 hours tomorrow. That should help a lot. Or maybe just hang out in the TA lab and ask tons of questions. Or maybe a mixture of both.  We will see. I'm really curious if you are also a CS student. I believe most people on here are, but I'm not exactly 100% sure if there is anyone who isn't. I'm really should start studying here in a bit.  But my wife and I have this thing where we don't do work or schoolwork from 5-7 just so we can talk and hang out. So maybe I'll just start studying later tonight. I am struggling to keep up with the person in first place. They aren't working, aren't studying in school right now too.  So they just have all the time in the world to do this competition. For someone like me, who has to study, work , and juggle other commitments.  It can be a lot to keep up wiht. with. I'm curious if we get points deducted if we mispell words or fail to use proper punctuation in this chat. I started watching the show friends all over again this past month, It is honestly so funny.   It's probably the only show from before 2010 that I actually find entertaining or funny Actually I'm not sure what year it was, but the show 24 with Jack Baur was awesome. That will never get old. And the office.  I think that started in like 2007 or something too.  I like that But most of the older shows just aren't entertaining to me given that most of their references are pointless. Holy cow I've been talking to myself for a really long time. I don't think you are ever going to get on this chat.  I wonder if you are even a real person.  Or if it just let me start talking to myself instead of waiting for someone. The world may never know. Or maybe you're a moderator who is just checking to see if I'm writing valid stuff. It won't let me type any more! Oh there we go. That was weird.  Or maybe you just want to see how long someone will talk to themselves before giving up on the other person and just ending the chat. I've found though that with such few numbers, if I end the chat then there is a good chance no one will get on again for the rest of the night.  Which means I can't catch up with the first place person. I do appreciate the anonymous feature, but it's still pretty easy to figure out who is who on the leaderboard based on how many points you rack up during a conversation. Or some people I've found just outright say where they stand in the rankings. I personally just want to get as close to the top as I can. But that has been so tough to do with that one person who doesn't actually go to school right now. I'm curious if they even qualify for prizes since they aren't in school.  They have a NetId and since they are going on a mission BYU still has them as a student. But they aren't studying, so do they still qualify? I think yes, I hope no.  That would greatly increase my chances if they weren't allowed to get points. I'm getting ready to watch monday night football. Typically I'm able to watch one quarter before my wife vetos it and we end up watching something else or doing something else. I think I need to go grocery shopping tonight come to think about it. We've got lots of meat, but not a lot of other stuff, greens, grains, etc. Taysom Hill is getting a big shoutout on sports center right now! Since he plays QB, RB, QR, and special teams for the saints.  Literally you don't know what he is going to do! Such a deadly weapon to have on your team. In case you didn't know he played for BYU like just 2 years ago I'm pretty sure. It's nice to see old BYU players doing well in the NFL.  Like Jamaal Williams, Ziggy Ansah, Kyle Van Noy, etc. we've actually produced a lot of solid defensive players. Alrighty, well I'm going to wrap this up in the next 5 minutes or so. It's been very nice talking to you chitchatter23 I hope you enjoy your week and have lots of success on your tests. Sounds like it's going to be pretty hectic. Honestly if I were a moderator I would totally just say nothing and watch people talk to themselves. That would be pretty entertaining.  People probably just sound stupid talking to themselves.  Especially for extended periods of time. This has been nice though.  I don't care if someone is reading all of this.  I've had fun just typing non stop this past 30 minutes. I think I've probably increased my WPM over that time too. Words per minute that is. I belive that I'm about 80-83 currently.  I'd have to take a test to check on that though. believe. Sometimes my fingers think they've hit certain letters but it actually just skims over them so I leave out certain letters when typing. I am trying to be better at that though. Just a sad Monday night.  Talking to myself for extended periods of time.  Eating goldfish and waiting for Monday night football to start. Oh cool, Lil Wayne is performing tonight at Monday night football. I don't think he's produced relevant music for quite some time now. I can't even remember the last song of his I heard. He's kind of become irrelevant honestly. I'm getting pretty tired, but like I said earlier: I'm worried that if I get off I won't get to chat again until tomorrow. Okay, got to go!",

I'm not so great with team sports or anything with a ball, but anything that requires you to work by yourself I'm pretty good a at! As a child I enjoyed watching TV and playing xbox.

        "body": "Oh yeah I'm super excited I just want to see if Dwight Howard actually pays out the wizards Hey we have to get together to watch one of the games this week Dude I'm getting really annoyed with the Fortnite game modes They're trying to do all these new unique moods and they're all really lame I find myself just playing solos over and over again Yo so I did the math today So it's going to cost me roughly $13-$17,000 to set up the call center that I was talking about Granted 10,000 of that is purely an employee salaries for the first month But I figured out that if I were employing people full-time and had contracts that allowed for constant use of those employees full-time I would probably make 23,000 in revenu Revenue per month So honestly I'm to see if I can make it work and do that all next summer so I can make some good money Yo do you ever watch the show highly questionable It's like the only show on right now on ESPN but I just hate how they do all this see or no It's like the only show on right now on ESPN but I just hate how they do all this see or no stuff  just gets really annoying after so long I'm so tired honestly We're going to P.F. Chang's tonight for dinner And then probably just coming home and relax and watch a movie with Winnie I'm pretty sure basketball for the NBA starts on Wednesday So will have to get together sometime between Wednesday and Saturday and watch one of the games If I remember correctly there should be a good game between I think it was the Warriors and the Rockets on like Saturday or something I've got some family coming into town so I'm not sure exactly which night would be best but will find a game and watch it together I know you don't have a car right now so I can come get you you can watch at my place and I can take you home after Hey when you figure it out make sure you let me know what her schedule is for that three V3 basketball I'll be back in just a sec I've got a couple things to do at home real quick I'm not sure if I mentioned this but I also researched that other idea I had Of the voice chat bot that can read your voice essentially I figured out that I need to use python to write all the Scripps but it's a little confusing when it comes to which software to use And which programs for voice recognition I should use I have yet to find a good one that can interpret tone of voice It's mainly just hearing voices and converting it to text and having text and converting it to to voice But there isn't really anything for interpreting the tone of voice that a person has So I've got a lot more research to do I think my best bet may be just talking to a professor in asking what they think is a good idea And maybe having them outline step for step process that I can follow the starting up this project I've got a lot of cleaning to do So I may be often on for the next couple of hours Honest but honestly I'll probably talk more in the morning then right Honest honestly I'll probably talk more in the morning then right now  I got a lot more free time tomorrow than today I kind of wanna watch Tarzan the legend of Tarzan like the new were one that they've made I think I'll just put it on as I study and get things ready in my house I think BYU basketball is going to start pretty soon to I think I'm actually a little excited for the season I will probably follow them closely until we start performing either really poorly or we just start playing proponents Poor opponents I'm currently watching a movie on TV called Hercules with Dwayne the rock Johnson I keep seeing all these commercials with Peyton Manning there so annoying Where he keeps doing those jingles for State Farm I haven't seen the movie Hercules in quite some time It's actually not too bad Emphasis on the word to Just got back from dinner we went to P.F. Chang's It was actually pretty good we were in and out about an hour and even had some leftovers They actually gave us free dessert to which is pretty cool We're just watching friends and hanging out now My dog is pretty jumpy and jumping all over me I should have a pretty busy day tomorrow I have to study all day for test that I'm taking this week that the end of the week I got a bunch of candy to eat tonight I got milk duds Butterfinger bites Mike and Ike's junior mints Dove milk chocolate candy bars All the good stuff So I was thinking if I can get some funding I think it be really cool if you could join me in doing this start up idea I have A lot of that is going to come down to margins and a lot of accounting stuff so I think it could actually be very applicable for you It may even be pretty lucrative to put on your resume to get you good job I really just need someone who understands finances and understands taxes and knows whether or not that if we can operate in the black or if it's not going to be a profitable Venture. I did some rough math Mattix it's gonna cost me about $10,000 upfront for Quitman actually more like $7000 And I'll be making about 23,000 per month Salary will cost about 10,000 for employees That's for just for guys around the clock or roughly 12 guys working part time So all net about $6000 myself each month which is honestly like three times more than I would make doing a different job And if you were to help me out and we could make this really effective I could even pay you a decent amount as well each month maybe two to $3000 for your time And if you were to help me out and we could make this really effective I could even pay you a decent amount as well each month maybe two to $3000 for your time and help We co We could even be partners I would probably take the majority so like 80% but you could still 20% When it comes to business as it's important that you split it up pretty dramatically like that so that there's no confusion in the business run smoothly when it comes to execu Execution If you don't do that then people can get very upset and partners can get into lawsuits and the company can completely fall apart So it's important that you establish these the column what is it called something tables Anyways the idea is that someone has a clear majority In this case since it's my ID in my business for the most part anyways I think it's completely reasonable to do a 20 leaning towards 80, 20 Cleaning my Way Leaning I'd really like to actually sit down with you and talk about it and see if it's something you might be interested in Should I get this up and running by next spring I could make a lot of money and just do it full-time during the summer I think at that point if they were profitable enough I may consider just doing it full-time Obviously I'll take classes where I can to make sure I graduate in Still have chances for other jobs down the road But if it's paying well enough and that's just not a lot of small scale It may be worth it to just do this full-time in really go crazy with sales and expansion I honestly would be fine managing a call center if it's something that I own myself Maybe you could help me pitch this idea to get some grants to validate this idea Since you're actually in the Marriott school for the accounting program it may actually help my case even more getting grants from the Marriott school I have a business management minor but being a CS student they may not be as willing to extend money to me The good thing is is I know the director Steve little he's in charge of the grants So it would be totally casual and really cool to speak with him and get that taken care of I'm thinking of doing some websites booths some false job advertising and also some false ads to see how interested Both our potential clients  and also BYU and UVU students If both of those check out this idea is totally viable and I might actually go full steam ahead The biggest challenge will be getting our first client, having someone who can trust us and is willing to take a risk with allowing us to use them as a pilot I do have experience in customer care but I would have to create a whole program for training and ensuring high-quality care That's a booth with phrases wording just everything altogether there's a lot that goes into it In the first month I would probably blow through about $5000 because I wouldn't want to make sure the thoroughly trained before we actually take on a client or else we risk lo Losing them In the second month when we actually start with the client we could end up making a lot more than expenses But we would still be paying off the debt that we went into the first month I would project by month three or four that we actually start operating in the black Or in other words I can finally take a cut out for myself The first two months probably would not be paid and honestly you may not be either But if that's a big issue for you maybe we can work something out I could pay you some kind a minimum like 1000 a month or something That way you can still do groceries and rent. For me since Michaela works it's not as big of a deal if I can't pay myself for a couple of months I'm actually really excited about this idea but I have a lot of research to do and I have a lot of people they need to speak with P.F. Chang's is not agreeing with my stomach right now Let's hope that I can find some time in the coming week to really do a lot of research into this business idea We will have to talk about it more when you come over to watch some basketball this week I'll need your help figuring out the budget Also in figuring out any legal financial things I need to be aware of when starting a business I didn't even think about the marketing the business licenses etc. associated with it I did not factor that in If I can find a client myself without having to advertise and that would save me a lot of money upfront I don't think I ever answered the prompt I would probably build myself a giant home With the wand Maybe make myself like a flying car or something I don't know what I'd want to do if I had a magic wand honestly We just finished I think season 7 of friends Monica and chandler just got married Oh yeah and Rachel is pregnant I think it's ross's At least I think that's what I remember from When I first watched the show I had a lot of candy... I'm like not feeling super great now I need to figure out a good way to study for my test I've always struggled with math like classes I never know the best way to study that works for me I think I'm going to go onto campus pretty early tomorrow morning and just study for like 5 hours or so And then I'll come home and eat Maybe play some fortnite And then probably study some more That is if I don't get distracted and start doing more research into my project I also forgot that I have a partner project I have to work on for 260 I am so stressed out for this test I have It's worth 25% of my overall grade And I really need to get at least a 70 in this class Like I get that doesn't sound like a big deal But trust me, I really need to get at least a B on this test because the other 2 midterms are going to be even harder So I need good grades to pad the bad ones I'm sure I'll get I was just thinking So they have typing tests to see how many words per minute you can write I wonder if they have a texting one Like how many words per minute can you text I'm sure for some people it would be like insane Not just because autocorrect fixes half the spelling mistakes, but also some business people who just wrote emails all day on their phones can probably write so quick Or people involved in social media for work Or just some kids with no life I bet you some people type like 90 words per minute I can do roughly 82-85 on the computer I feel like that is a pretty decent amount I'm not sure what is considered like super skilled though I'd have to look that up Oh whoops I didn't realize that I still had this chat open with you from yesterday I am absolutely exhausted So I basically have the whole day to study which is nice. I just finished revising some ads that I'm going to put on google adwords I made 2 different ads and I'm going to put them up for about 3.27 per day So it should come out to $100 for a month of ads.  I'm going to let it run for 1 week so like $23 and then I'll cancel the ads and see what I can learn from the data collected. Unfortunately since it's not a physical product but more of a service that I will be providing, I won't be able to qualify for an I-Corp grant.  Which stinks because I could have gotten roughly 1-2 thousand just for the purpose of validating my idea I may go in and talk to Steve Liddle and see what he thinks about the idea and what i would have to do to qualify for a grant. But his time is pretty valuable and mid semester he is probably insanely busy.  So I may not be able to find a time to meet with him unfortunately We can talk about it tonight when you come to watch the game. I'm so happy NBA is back on.  Celtics vs 76ers should be a lot of fun to watch tonight. I may actually go on campus to study for a little bit today.  Maybe just an hour.  My epic games engine updates in like 2 minutes there, but 4 hours at home. That's how big the wifi difference is between campus and here So maybe I'll just go, let it update, and then head home. Quick trip I really need to study for my test, and i will. But i also just need to relax a little today.  Last week was so crazy and up until yesterday I didn't really get much of a break And even yesterday I was running around quite a bit. I just realized that you haven't actually seen our new place yet or our dog you haven't seen us in a while actually haha should be fun.  I'll probably grab some soda's to watch the game tonight. Give me a heads up as to what kinds you like before i go get them later. I'm still waiting before I send out this ad campaign because i want to get a couple of people to edit/view it before submitting it. I just realized that my little nephew comes into town this afternoon I'm actually pumped! He seriously is the funniest thing Just likes to play non stop that and watch despicable me Michaela is going to go see him tonight while we watch the game And I'm going to just go see him tomorrow instead. I can't wait to see that little bugger he is the cutest. So I think i'm going to do the following with my idea This next month I'll be running various ad campaigns both testing which ads are more effective and also if there is an interest in my idea. I'll also be running some fake job opening ads to see if any students nearby are interested in a job Meanwhile I'll be fine tuning the costs of equipment and software for setting everything up. Should everything check out my next step will be setting up a full business plan. I will then simultaneously start procuring clients and hopefully with all of that, I can set up the call center sometime during winter semester or spring term. Just posted a dummy job posting on Indeed to see what kind of response I get Like how many applicants, etc. If I could get like 7-10 applicants within a months time then I would think that would be enough people to cover my needs.  I wouldn't have to hire all of them, I could interview most of them. So turns out it downloaded the new update quicker than I thought It's been 2.5 hours and it's finally done. So I'm going to try out the new game mode for a bit I'll talk to you in a bit It's actually taking a bit to load up I'm not sure if it's the new ATKs or what but something has this update performing much slower than previous ones I really like the new events tab basically they allow you to compete in tournaments and a new one starts right after the other typicallly each one structured differently I am a little bummed with indeed it takes them a couple of hours to approve your job posting I'd really like to get that thing up and runing runnning and see some feedback on it Maybe I'll post jobs elsewhere too and see what's most effective Indeed rejected my posting they said that it didn't meet their standards even though I followed their template almost perfectly I petitioned to see what is going on I really need to start working more in my free time I've still got the same job and it pays really well, but I haven't really been working too often recently I'll only put in like about 5 hours a week If I could double that then i could be living a lot more comfortably and saving money each month too. Luckily Michaela works full time so there isn't a need for me to work But it helps a lot for me to work a little then I'm down for it I am so tired still I think i might have like a minor cold I originally thought it was because Winnie (my dog) wakes me up at night, but the past two nights she slept through the entire night and i'm still feeling tired in the morning Makes me think that I might have a cold instead It would make more sense honestly. I just started watching this new show it's on netflix Knights something It's about the knights templar and the holy grail very interesting Netflix has been pretty bad at getting good shows and movies on there recently I've been stuck watching the same old tv shows over and over they need new content if people are to keep paying for their service Yo so the game should start at around six tonight So does my interview I'll probably be able to get you around like 6:45 meaning we will start watching around 7 so we will probably only catch the second half Also you mentioned Russ  isn't playing tonight Why is that? Did he get hurt? or suspended? That's really weird that he isn't playing Wow i've gotten far behind So the show i'm watching is called nightfall it's super good you should definitely watch it sometime I really want to start working on this company idea I have I haven't quite posted any ads or anything yet I still am waiting because I'd like my dads opinion on how to proceed given that he's done this before I also want to make sure i don't waste any time or money on anything unless it's a smart idea I've got some google adword ads ready to go and am currently pending approval to put some ads on indeed they're making me prove I'm a real company first, which i'm not so I would either have to file and get a business license, or I would have to make it appear like I'm getting bills sent to my office that Both of which aren't actually happening so I don't know what to do about hta Maybe I'll send myself mail under the company name I plan on using and then post a job opening I just want to see what interest is there maybe I could post something on handshake I'd have to look into that first though i'm not sure if they allow students to put stuff up there I don't think they do actually I just went there and looked it's more for recruiting than putting job openings up Which I don't think they would like all that much to be honest I'm feeling gross I've had like 20 milk duds since 2 not a great idea I also haven't been super productive I have had all today to study but haven't made super great use of that time honestly Hopefully I can be more productive tomorrow I am trying to get quotes from different call centers but they all want tons of information from me and want to call me to discuss pricing Honestly It's a lot I might just do it though so I can get some accurate pricing",

I'm curious, are you a moderator? For some reason I keep running into chats where the other person doesn't respond.  I don't know if that is supposed to happen. Maybe there is a glitch in the program right now.  Not exactly sure. And to respond to the prompt.  Yes.  i don't think catfishing needs to be done by a human to actually be catfishing. If anything it's even more likely to be catfishing if it's not a human doing it. Because I believe that catfishing basically means fooling someone into thinking that they're in a relationship with someone they're not actually with. So if a computer were doing that, it would totally be catfishing. I think it's going to be very interesting what kinds of laws and moral ideas will be put into place when AI becomes a lot more normal and commonly used. Also does the United States decide on the policy for AI, does each country decide for themselves, or does  an international panel  decide on the laws? Lots of uncertainty there. I'm going to give you a couple more minutes before just giving up on this conversation. I'm hoping that these chats aren't disregarded for having someone on the other end who won't respond.  Because that would stink.  I've had a couple chats now like this... ... where I just talk to myself for like 30 minutes before just giving up. So, I'm just going to end this chat and sit in the que waiting for the next person to come along.  Only so much I can talk about with myself.",

I think true artificial intelligence is when a computer is able to think on it's own.and that it is able to learn from experiences. It's super important that the computer is able to learn from its experiences so that it can official and completely take over the world. Because that's the purpose of artifici Artificial intelligence isn't it? And also the artificial intelligence must have a body that is able to interact with the rest of the world. Also, it has to have a preference on food. Like it needs to have a favorite food and enjoy certain things over other things. Almost like a personality. That would be wicked awesome. It must hold and keep a conversation. And it must keep a conversation about normal things. Not just give back random words like Siri does sometimes. Or answers that don't make any sense at all. I've heard they are making some great advances on artificial intelligence. It would be great to invest in stocks or to purchase products of companies developing artificial intelligence. Siri has weird responses I say \"how is the weather today?\" And she says \"hmm...I can't seem to answer you right. Which is what happens. Or I say \"Hey Siri, call my friend\" and she says \"what would you like your text to say?\" Ya super frustrating",

Are you dead Well that only took two minutes I suppose it's official Dead aren't you?

There have been a lot of studies that show that the more parent involvement there is in the classroom, the higher the test scores end up being. This is also why a lot of low income schools struggle, because the parents are all working fulltime to support their families. They lose that involvement",

We would be able to explore the galaxy and search for other inhabitable planets. If we were to find another Earth-like planet for humans to inhabit, that would be when things get interesting. I think that in the time that it would take to develop faster-than-light space travel and explore the galaxy, the Earth would continue to be depleted of all of it's natural resources. At that point, the rich will be able to escape and the poor will be left behind to suffer the consequences of the many years of lavish lifestyles lived by the wealthy. It would be like something out of a sci-fi movie. And all that is not to mention what we might discover in the cosmos. On this Earth-like planet that we might find there would likely be unique life forms that have never existed on this Earth.",

        "body": "Hello how's it going Am I going to talk with a real person tonight or just myself for like 10 minutes? I have had a super busy day so far.  Finally getting a little bit of time to relax My dog is being a little crazy though so who knows if I'll actually get to relax. I had a test, quiz, and a full day of classes and visiting with family from out of town. My sister-in-law actually got locked out of her place too so I had to give her a ride to and from work today since her car keys were inside. That was interesting Just got back from taking her home from work. She works for some soda shop here in Provo I'm just watching ESPN and relaxing.  Perks of getting all my homework done a day early I have a project and test this Friday though which I'll have to double down on tomorrow. Because Friday evening we are going to be going to a big party with my family so I'll have to have everything done before then. Okay, well.  It's been nice chatting with you chitchatter23 Responding to the prompt.  I don't think computers in general will ever be given the right to vote, however I do believe that certain Artificial Intelligences will be given that right. There is actually an AI that's a citizen of Saudi Arabia currently.  So certain countries do seem to think it's a real possibility that we will have citizens that are computer s one day Pretty cool stuff BYU has a couple of courses currently for CS students. One is about Artificial Intelligence and the other is Machine Learning.  Pretty neat stuff. There is also a research lab that does some AI ML projects such as chit chat.  I believe it's called the recognition and cognition lab I think it would be really cool to help out on a project such as this one. Just learning how the technology works and the basic architecture behind the programs would be really neat I have considered really diving in to that subject. It would be pretty neat.  But I'm a little unsure I think I like frontend development more than anything else right now. So like UI/UX stuff it's much more engaging and it's fun to be able to see a lot of your work actually materialize. I haven't taken 256 or 456 yet, but I'm going to take 256 next semester That's UI/UX in case you were wondering/ I think I am going to take 3 CS classes next semester. But probably just 2 and then one of the math requirements I still have linear algebra to take. So that will be interesting I'll probably just meet with an academic counselor to plan out my next couple of semesters. I'm watching friends now, and It's really remarkable how applicable like all of their references are to today as well. I watch some of these older shows and their references just get lost on me like all the time. That's why friends is so great! It's a classic! okay, i'm going to go!  Bye",

        "body": "Good morning How are you doing today If I had a magic wand I would totally just make it so people can't talk when they are being mean or annoying Probably would also throw fireworks out of it all of the time. Also, assuming this wand is even more powerful than wands portrayed in harry potter and I could literally do anything with it, I would probably just stroll into a hospital and start curing any sick kids that are there I don't know if I would cure everyone though.. As sad as that is, if every old person that there is lived from every injury and illness than the US economy would collapse. Social Security already struggles because of people living to be too old. If even more lived and that age expectancy went up more it would just destroy future generations who are forced to care for them. Just some food for though. thought. I think the best solution to our social security woes is to at least in the short term raise the age of when people can access it by about 5 years.  Or, offer a super cheap subsidized health insurance plan for elderly and cut down how much social security they receive in exchange I know it stinks, but people do on some level need to be responsible for their own retirement.  I think that if you want to retire as soon as you're able to get social securit security just so you don't need to make money and can live off of that it just wrong. Also, I think that full time jobs regardless of what field they are in should be required by law to force employees to take out at least some kind of 401k and contribute a bare minimum amount to it. Because when people opt out of those sorts of benefits, it's not just hurting them, but it hurts the rest of us. It's like someone who is fully capable of getting a decent job, but refuses so that they can just get unemployment benefits from the government. It's just wrong.  Legally it's not, but its still just wrong. That's why I think it should be a law that people get independent, PRIVATE 401k's that the government is not involved with and not responsible for. At least start now so that we can resolve the social security issue at the very least by the time we are retired. Because the senate and those making the budget decisions only think short term.  Not even really past 10 years.  Most bills are purely band aids for the short term.  And being as they are only elected for short periods of time, they don't care about anything other than what makes them look good to get re-elected. And by forcing us to take out 401k's would probably just make everyone mad honestly. But it would be responsible and would help us in the long run It's either that or they need to make big cuts elsewhere which they aren't willing to do. That is another issue that I get annoyed with.  Media and society in general now a days blame everything on Millenials. Millenials killed American Cheese, Millenials won't buy homes Millenials are waiting to get married. The real issue is that they caused so many problems for us that we are left to clean up the mess and can't afford these things. gotta go!",

In my TED talk I would mention how easy it is to just let fear take over, to give up and just forget about the goals we once had. I would say that most people do this, and miss out on achieving their full potential. But that to overcome it we simply need to exercise our faith muscle. Faith is the opposite of fear. And by excercising this faith muscle we can start accomplishing things in our life that we never thought possible. We can do things we never dreamed of. Faith is the power by which all things are done. It is the force that causes all things on this earth to act. It is essential for our progression Okay, it's been great chatting with you.

I agree with you: I think if people everywhere started caring about their health, so many problems would be solved. Healthy Families generally have the healthiest individuals. Even if there are illnesses, those individuals in strong families are able to cope better. How much schooling does it require to become a dietician.

        "body": "Hey! Sweet Yo I had the sweetest time at the game last night! I got to go down onto the field for the entire first half of the game. We got tickets with my parents to see the game behind the end zone on the North side of the field But my dad's friend has these passes to go onto the field, so I went down for the first half with him and my dad went down for the second half It was awesome We got to just follow along the field as the ball went up and down We were like in the hawaii defense huddle just listening to their coach getting angry with them it was super cool We ended up getting home at around 12 though Winnie (my dog) was not happy about that she ended up playing till 1 in the morning So we ended up staying up too this morning we totally slept in on accident and missed all of church Our ward meets at 8 am which kind of stinks so we woke up around 10 and just missed it all So we just kind of took the morning slow and got ready for the day We drove up and through the alpine loop, which was snowing lots and then came to my in laws for dinner/ to do laundry Winnie ended up peeing on Michaela's lap because she was so nervous so that was lots of fun But now we are just chilling out and watching some football as my mother in law makes dinner Fun stuff I I've started a new project at work we are now building out some employee management apps for some clients that I'm helping with I have a good prompt to talk about: Do you think that alternative energies are effective and worth the investment? I personally would say yes Although currently it still does cost quite a bit to operate clean energy plants, the benefits long term are so much better first off, the supply never really dies down.  We will almost always have solar and wind and some of these other solutions that have been invented the trade off is though that coal and natural gas and oil are far cheaper for us to use However, they are limited in supply and they are awful for the enviroment If you can use clean energy for long enough then a lot of times you can get your money's worth out of it. Another thing I'd be curious about your take on is the new bill prop 2 here in utah I think it's very interesting I think it was good that some compromises were made though regarding how strict the bill will be Marijuana should be legal to people who need it medically, but the problem I see with it is that people will use really lame and often times faked illnesses to get access to i it I think the bill is good in that they limit who can produce and sell it.  But, I think that it still doesn't do enough to ensure that only those who are very sick can get access to it. I worry that our state will just be filled with people who claim that for \"nerves\" they need to have marijuana or some other lame made up illness That's the only drawback that this bill will have It just makes it too easy for people to get it. Another interesting topic is that of space travel And whether it's even worth it. I personally would say yes. If you look back on the space race and all the technologies that it brought, it has a huge benefit to society In more recent years we have learned how to land rockets and reuse them(looking at spacex) Been able to make them economical and send people as tourists into space and send more satellites out as well In addition to that, the possibilities with establishing colonies on the moon and mars are just incredible They've discovered ice on the moon and on mars so we know that we could get water from there We have also discovered that the resources necessary for making fuel are present on both the moon and mars This makes it possible not just to land on these planets, but also to leave and return from them If we can establish a colony on the moon then we can then do tests and refine technologies at an exponential speed currently the international space station conducts experiments in zero gravity all the time but having an established colony in a sterile enviroment would make it possible to do so much more. In addition to all of these technologies that we can discover and create there we could also mine the moon for it's resources I don't remember specifically which minerals the moon has, but I have read that there are minerals there that are  becoming scarce on earth and would be very valuable for us. We could mine these materials and ship them back to the states When we have these kinds of operations going on, it makes it possible to create jobs and work there This would allow for more people to go to the moon and businesses to go there as well. These possibilities allow for people to then colonize and have families there thus making a whole nation of it's own on the moon They would probably establish their own laws and govern themselves it could also serve as a base for launching more rockets throughout the galaxy With lower gravity it would require minimal effort to send a rocket off from the moons surface We could test out space elevators! and dock ships out of orbit There are so many possibilities I am really excited to see something like this happen So returning to my original point, I think it would totally be worth exploring space I think the possibilites combined with all the technology that comes with space exploration is totally worth it. I think a lot of Elon Musk and spacex when it comes to the future of our planet. People who are innovative and discovering these new technologies and on the forefront of discovery Autonomous cars are something that are especially intruiging to me Currently we have lots of traffic in our big cities.  Typically its because someone taps their brakes really hard and it causes a chain reaction that goes for miles With autonomous vehicles this wouldn't happne! happen they could communicate with each other and flow perfectly on interstates causes traffic to decrease Merge perfectly without causing other cars to brake They could eliminate the need for intersections because cars would be able to talk with each other perfectly and avoid hitting each other as they pass through And on top of all of this efficiency that they will bring, they would also eliminate millions of deaths per year When you think of it, cars are death trap s we get ourselves killed all the time by stupid human errors cause while driving Autonomous cars would avoid accidents and save millions of lives per year currently tesla has made some huge strides in both vehicle safety and autonomous vehicles Their cars are extremely safe to the point where cars can get absolutely totalled and people walk away unharmed And they already have developed cars with autonomous features, they're just fine tuning it and waiting for legislation allowing for it's full adopted use Another curious thought of mine is technology causing more harm or is it helping more to our future? Technology has definitely done amazing things for us, but I feel like our world is getting very polluted with technology From Cyberattacks to just poor use of technoloyg technology people are misusing technology left and right But overall I think with this increase in technology there is also an increase in awarenees awareness We are becoming more aware of the things that we are doing wrong and trying to correct them with even more technology For example with the industrial revolution we discovered so many good things, however in the process we destroyed a lot of our enviroment Currently we are more aware of this and have placed laws and created new technologies to combat all of the harm that we have done. We are probably creating problems now that we are not even aware of, but I'm sure that eventually we will realize what we are doing and again, course correct Something i'd be interested in hearing about from you is whether or not Lord of the Rings, or some other movie is the greatest on earth I think a lot of people hold harry potter, star wars, or other movies ahead of it. but I think overall Lord of the Rings is still king in terms of the best movies/books ever made Not only is it just so classic but also all of the amazing storylines so perfectly woven it just creates a perfect movie I don't know if anyone could ever a better movie than the Lord of the Rings Maybe like 20 years in the future we will appreciate and want either a remake or a spinoff of it but for now it's definitely the best movie I think as a kid I used to watch the two towers like almost every week i had almost the entire movie memorized The one thing that disappointed me though was the hobbit movies It was really good and all, but I would've appreciated them narrowing it down to just 2 movies and removing all of the extra stuff that they added I liked the first movie and appreciated the third movies action sequences, but I didn't really like the white orc plot line Going back to autonmous vehicles like I was talking about earlier. This is why I think they'll be huge in the future! The car industry in recentry years has seen many new changes that have been revolutionizing the way we see trasnportation. The biggest technological advancement, arguably in my opinion would be that of autonomous vehicles. These are vehicles that drive themselves with no human interaction. Tesla has hit news recently with their accouncements that they will have fully autonomous vehicles running within the following yeras year that is, pending government approval and liscensing restrictions. But even with all this exciting technology, what effect is this going to have on America's future? Not only can autonomous vehicles help prevent fatalities, they can prevent billions of dollars in damages each year making america not only safer, but more economical. In 2015 i remember reading that for roughly every 100 million miles driven there are about 1.12 vehicle fatalities. This may not seem like alot, but considering that there are billions of miles driven in the states thats like tens of thousands of fatalities that we didn't need to have happe happen. Those were all a result of human error. They could have all been prevented with autonomous vehicles. Elon musk thinks that they can have autonomous vehicles that will eliminate these deaths completely I get that a lot of people are skeptical as to whether or not these vehicles are actually safe enough to put our trust in. Especially due to the softwareware malfunctions or lack of human control while driving. But, the fact that AV's will follow traffic laws every time without fail, they'll have updatable software to fix and bugs and they'll improve the quality of their thinking over time, it would be dumb to not accept them. They'll prevent accidents on our roads. Fortunately companies are working in coordination with state and federal governments to push through laws to ensure vehicle safety Both with traditional and autonomous vehicles When these vehicles hit the road in our cities they will help prevent not only the loss of life, but also prevent thousands of car crashes each year saving us billions of dollars in damages. These expenses are a huge burden that AV's can help eliminate. AV's can predict traffic patterns and keep up a constant speed to prevent bottlenecks and accidents on our highways. Time lost is money lost in most commuters worlds. Not only will improved traffic mean more time for the conveniences of work and life, but also more flexibility with work for many as well. Besides just reducing traffic, we could also increase speed limits without causing danger to anyone 2 hour commutes can turn into 30 minute rides instead On the flip side, you could argue that technology is not advanced enough to achieve these feats. The other advantage to AV's is that they can collect data on what is happening in their customers cars and use this to predict what it should do in various scenarios So someone who is driving a tesla themselves, if they brake and the car thinks it wouldn't have braked, they company can look at that scenario and the camera footage and see whether they need to tweak their algorithms to account for that given situation. AV's also have the capability to reduce the need for so many parking lots in cities. With AV's one could run a quick errand or go to a quick meeting and have the car drive around the block or even head home for the day to not have to pay for expensive parking or take up parking in the city. Imagine the possibilities for cities and the opportunites for growth if all of the sudden half of the garages we currently have are no longer necessary. Not only could cities save on teh expensive cost of parking garages, but they could use this extra space is busy cities to build another productive thing such as a park or a commercial office building Many cities and businesses make quite a bit of money on parking and rely on its profits to drive other trasnportation projects forward. However, the potential from other busineesses in these areas will bring them more profits and boost the economy in the city so it would probably still be a win for cities It's hard to imagine a real world application where this would even be possible, cars doing the driving for us. Imagine going to the airport for a business trip or maybe to visit relatives in a different state. I would imagine most people would park their car in an economy lot and leave it there for several days until they got back. not only that, but they are forced to wait 30-60 minutes for the transit from the airport, onto a shuttle and finally to their car. With AV's people will be able to drop themselves off right at the drop off lane at the airport, tell their car to go home to save on the cost of parking, and upon arrival back home they could have it come pick them up right at baggage claim. Not only could people save money, but the convenience of the ordeal will be extremely lucrative in an ever evolving society of innovators. Airports generally are forced to build on lots twice as big as the airports themsevles to accomodate for parking Once again we could save the money and build more productive things than parking in those areas AV's will make way for smaller roads which will decrese the need for large road budgets and save room in cities. Many US interstates can have up to as many as 5-7 lanes for transit going in both directions. These enormous interstates are meant to accommodate the heavy transit that many cities see around the country. While some owuld argue that we should have larger roads with more cars and AV's on the road. Because of their advanced driving abilities we will be able to move more traffic faster and reduce the road congestion. Traffic lanes could also be able to be way smaller due to the accuracy or AV's in keeping distance from surrounding vehicels. Many traffic lanes are fairly wide to compensate for human error, but with AV's we can save on the space in cities and tighten the lanes allowing for bike lanes, larger sidewalks to promote walking parks benches and trees too Cities can save on less road maintenance, a key issue currently in the US We could use this money elsewhere with less money coming in from traffic tickets and parking, this could help exponentially in compensating for the lack of revenue being generate to AV's AV's are going to revolutionize the way we see trasportation because they will provide greater convenience with commuting. Many parents often face the dilemma of how they will be able to take their kids to so many activities and also work to pay the bills. With AV's parents will be able to drive their kids to school while sitting at their desks working. Their cars can tak their kids for them with no worries of risk or injury. The possibilites are endless! Many would argue that these innovations will make us more distant and lazy though too After all we are becoming a super lazy country Lots of obesity, smart phones, less pressure to marry and commit to creating families, all of those factor in to being lazy AV's are already legal in a few states so we know that some states are ready for AV's to become a standardized thing. There have been several laws permitting their use in states across the us currently and many efforts are being made to legalize the use across the country Telsa is so confident that I remember them offering an option to prepay for their autonomous features to have the car preprogrammed for it Several other companies are also working on their own models and pushing to have them ready by 2020 to compete with tesla. Automated busses, trucks and cars will revolutionize the transportation industry. However, even with all of these amazing changes that could result from this technology many are still skeptical as to autonomous vehicles safety and also the effects it could have on jobs. One of the main concerns that people have with this is that if they reduce traffic and accidents, what will happne to the thousands of jobs people currently have realted to commercialized trasnportation not only will many law enforcement officiers lose work but also many commercial drivers as well. There are millions of commercial drivers working in the US currently Thats a lot of jobs that potentially could be cut or phased out due to AV's although they are obviously the economical and safe thing to do considering there are so many crashes each year One must keep in mind that there are very real people out there who currently rely on this lack of technology in the market to make a living. If they were to enter the commercial market than millions would lose their jobs. If we could help curb this job loss the government may need to coordinate to come up with solutions and new opportunities for work. In addition, with the lack of money from tickets and fines coming in, the governments resources for repairing our roads would be greatly reduced cuasing many problems to our already crumbling road system. State governments already spend billions each year There is no denying that AV's will have a positive effect, but the only question to be had is does America trust AV's can I trust these cars with my safety? can I trust they will perform exactly as they are meant to or, will it malfunciton and be the reason for my death or the death of my loved one. Just as operator-less elevators once scared many, autonomous vehicles are going to be benificial and we don't need to be scared. Yeah I honestly don't know if much more can be said about autonomous vehicles Another topic that has interested me quite a bit over the years is that of minimum wage Especially with amazon raising theirs to $15 an hours Although minimum wage in general seems like a very lucrative thing, many do not understand the damaging affects this will have on the poor and working class.  I don't say this from like a middle or upper class perspective thinking only of myslef but as a fellow minimum wage (somewhat) earning college student with the same concerns about finances and same frustrations about income. Many places (primarily Seattle) have been pushing to raise the minimum wage to$15 per hour they hope that this will help out the lower class. I get it, and I understand that people really want this raise.  But I don't believe people understand the downside to the wage hike.  If t they raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour then there will be a decline in the number of jobs for temporary/part time workers there will also be a decrease in demand for those same products and services that those companies rovide Which means, ultimately they will eliminate jobs. In addition to that people probably won't be able to afford a lot of goods Although it sounds like a good idea raising the minimum wage will cause empolyers to fire employees to make up the difference from having to pay so much more In many states the minimum wage is around $9 per hour.  So if they were to raise it to 15 then people would have to charge like twice as much for their products to pay employe employees what we are going to start seeing are jobs being eliminated and either replaced by robots or simply one employee will be forced to cover the work of 2-3 It's going to be terrible! The small companies won't be able to compete and will shut down or downsize dramatically. Big companies will be okay, but they will increase their pricing big time. It will just create inflation for these companeis And for our economy. Which is terrible for everyone honestly It's no good getting paid $6 more an hour when your rent goes up by $200 and your milk and other goods increase by $1-5 each! That's just stupid. i'd rather make $9 in an economy with lower prices than have to do that. We just watched a quiet place and it was pretty good. Very intense, but a pretty good story line I was definitely filled with some anxiety and stress during that movie, because of all of the suspense. I am not sure how I feel about John dying Not a cool event in the movie I was kind of hoping that John would be the one to just go crazy and kill all 3 of them and that their family would all live through it But that didn't happen Super smart though everything they did From padding the walls with newspapers to the oxygen for the baby to the light system and what it meant Really smart ideas that they had I hear that they are thinking of doing a second movie But from the perspective of a different family I would totally go see it We are now watching Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban I forgot how much I really like these movies Kind of makes me Want to Go Back and read the books over again I really like this one Because hermione does that thing where she goes back in time so she can go to more classes Also the whole werewolf thing is super cool Ohhhh and the dementors! Super fun I think this is one of the better movies in this series that they did Some of the books are definitely better, but this is probably the best movie I can't even remember the last time I watched this movie Or any of the Harry Potter movies for that matter Lol my mother in laws dog just fell off the couch trying to walk over to me Super funny I'm pretty excited for tomorrow I don't really have much going on, but I've got a fun project to work on Granted it's with a partner who isn't super involved or super creative, but it should still be fun I think I'm just going to do everything on my own and if he wants to Chip in he always can haha I'm thinking of tutoring as well for like $10 an hour for CS 142 Just to see if I'm good at it and if I am I'm good at it then I'll start charging like $15 an hour I have a job that pays well already, but I just think tutoring 142 would be a lot of Fun! Plus it'll help me brush up on some of my c++ skills Something I haven't coded in for a while That would help me a lot honestly I've had some interviews where they've liked me To code in c++ but all I really have done recently is java Maybe I'll look into it actually Could be fun But only after this week is over, I've already got a lot of other work to do I have my big midterm on Thursday or Friday Haven't quite decided when I want to take it Bye the way, In case you were wondering Harry just made aunt pitunya super fat And she floated away Or not his aunt but his uncles mother actually I don't know how Harry is never terrified of everything that goes on in his magical world I would be absolutely petrified honestly JK Rowling is seriously so creative though All of the little creative details in her books are just amazing honestly I'm pretty excited for our 3v3 intramural basketball team Should be lots of fun I haven't played in quite some time though Maybe like 3 months now, probably a little less But I think I've still got it I guess we will find out when we have our first game probably I'm going to go eat some snacks Be back in a bit I was a little disappointed with the football games today Not a lot of good matchups Well, the patriots playing right now is But other than that there aren't a lot of good games on I think I've only really been interested with packers, rams and chiefs this year So any other game just isn't all that interesting to me Hagrid is now a teacher For your information in this movie we are watching We need to schedule a day To watch nba basketball this week What are you Answering the original prompt, I would totally choose Mozart I actually made a playlist on Spotify called \"beats by Mozart\" it's for studying It's got a photo of mozart with beats headphones on as the cover for the playlist I thought it was pretty funny I really want to Validate my Business idea but am not sure where to start Whether to see competitors rates or to see what I could charge BYU students I think I'll create a qualtrics survey and try and get some people to respond to that for me I need to make it short enough to where people will be interested in finishing,  but long enough to get some solid data I think I'm going to give out some kind of prize raffle sort of thing to encourage people to participate in my survey I think there are lots of grants available for validating business ideas on campus If I can validate the business idea based on a salary projection than I can probably convince them to give me like $500 to validate the student labor aspect Of the idea We applied for one of these grants last year But we're denied because it wasn't really descriptive enough But I think I know how to get the grant now It shouldn't be too difficult There is also this cool thing you Can do where you can make a google ad spoof Basically it will show a title on google, but the webpage actually goes no where, but it tracks how many people that see the ad click on it And you can see demand based on that So maybe I'll do that too I have lots of research to get done before doing any of it I also have lots of research to do for my other idea Of making that machine learning bot to determine angry customers from normal ones I don't even know where I would start for that one I think I need to research which products and services would even allow for that kind of work I then need to find a project that already has voice recognition built into it for determining words and potentially also Determining tone of voice If something like that doesn't exist then I may need to Make it myself That could be a project in itself honesty Honestly But I think it could be very cool and be very profitable If it doesn't pay off at the very least it will be really good experience for me I could show it off as a project I've done for my resume It would be really cool So I need to 1) identify the hardware that I could use 2) determine the languages I need to use 3) determine the basic algorithm/ routine that it would use to maximize efficiency and to teach itself how to read voices The only real big issue is finding a cheap method for storing all the data that it will be gathering as I am testing this I may have to store it locally on my computer until I can raise money to pursue this idea on a larger scale There are a lot of problems to solve still I don't know how to do machine learning Or where to really start when creating this software I don't know if I'll need help or even if it'll take a team of people There is a chance I may have to get funding in order to build a team that can focus on this project Obviously I will try to do all of it on my own, but I may end up discovering f that I'm going to need some Help on it It's all super exciting honestly Once this semester cools down a little bit i will probably really Start to pursue this more I'm really excited though! I'm thinking I may actually start my research into How to Build that software I mentioned tonight Maybe just to get an idea as to where to begin And potentially go see some professors tomorrow to see what they would suggest to build it I am super sleepy already I don't know It If I'm sick or what But I've been really tired like all the time recently My only guess is that I've got to be a little sick on some level I don't know why else I would be this tired I'm torn between things I'd like to get done and things that I know need to get don It's really bothersome honestly I really need to start studying more for my big test I need to start thinking of other business ideas though I need to have some more in case these two ones don't pan out Validation honestl is key with these ideas I need to prove out whether they will work or not And be ready to go through with them if they do Seriously though there is never enough time during the semester for these side projects It really stinks honestly Im curious your thought on whether or not censorship is effective I went to India a couple of months ago and while there got to see a couple of movies both on TV and in the theatres They actually censor Alcohol and Smoking there So like in the actual movie when there is a beer or a cigarrette they'll blur out the bottle or smoke It's really interesting And in commercial breaks on tv they will put messages about how the movie contains smoking and how bad it is for you. I think that although it's really weird, it is actually really effective I know that it would never fly here in the US, but maybe one day when smoking really starts to die down then they will consider it. India actually has a lot less people who smoke and drink then the US Oh that trip was actually awesome So obviously it's much cheaper than the US We stayed at some five start hotels for like $30 a night! It was really cool They also had massages and hair cuts for like $3 total it was awesome I got a full shave and head massage for $3! Super awesome I would totally consider going back there on a vacation Honestly I would consider going to anywhere in southeast asia Because it's so cheap to stay and eat there! We are thinking of actually going on a vacation to Hawaii next year! The polynesian cultural center, pinnaple groves, nice beaches It would be so much fun! But it'll probably be pretty expensive to be honest. So i'll have to start saving up a lot haha I have a question for you So I'm a Computer Science major so my opinion is pretty biased but, I'm curious your thoughts on computers in the classroom I think that it's really good to have them! For me at least it helps me be more productive in my classes, but I can understand how it could also be a major distraction. I don't really know how it is in your accounting classes, but I have a lot of teachers who say that no computers helps more than computers But I honestly think that we should be able to have computers in our classes. I wonder what would happen if instead of having hundreds of countris and governments around the world we just had one large country and president who decided everything for us When we watch all these movies about foreign galaxies It's always like each planet contains one civilization and one single country essentially Like in guardians of the galaxy Star Wars, etc. I wonder why we have never really considered it It could just be that our civilization is so much newer than others I think that we will probably have a moon country that's completely independent before we have a single government for all of the earth Hey I'm back! I was thinking a little bit about space exploration like I was talking about earlier I was wondering whether or not it would be better for the government to start increasing funding to NASA to allow them to pursue space exploration instead of leaving it in the hands of the private sector to do that. Currently it seems like they have a bunch of contracts with private companies so that they don't have to build rockets themselves. I honestly don't even know how they would catch up at this point. Lots of these private companies have been developing these technologies for a really long time now I'm not even sure how much money it would take for NASA to catch up should they have decided to pursue it. The other concern I have with Space exploration is that the company leading the charge in innovation and rocket technology appears to be SpaceX, but as it's run by someone who is not an American, i'm curious if should money come into play if they would build rockets for other countries such as Russia and China Obviously it would be unlikely given that their facilities are all in the United States, but it is a real possibility Not that other countries shouldn't be allowed to explore space too, but I feel that it would be better if the United States was at the forefront of space exploration. That or a joint partnership between countries If we were to establish a colony on the moon then we might have some other issues. Who controls the interests there? Would it also be some kind of international council Would a specific country seize complete control? Would it be completely neutral and only the private parties involved would have a say? Or would the American Government essential force the private sector to allow it to establish itself on the moon And later on when people start to have families on the moon would they decide to go independent and create their own country or government? Lots to consider. I once watched this cool video about settling the moon and the financial opportunities involved It was very intriguing. I think that if I had the opportunity then I would probably want to take my family and live on the moon It would be awesome! But I don't know if that would be in our best interest. It honestly depends. I really hope that our planet doesn't turn into some Elisium movie type scenario Where the world is just a giant desert and going to the dumps. I could see it becoming a really crowded, run down place Especially with all the damage we are constantly doing to it. But I do believe that mankind is good enough to take care of it and resolve problems that we cause. So tomorrow should be pretty exciting! It's my second anniversary! So we are going to go out to dinner Unfortunately since it's in the middle of the semester we can't really do much travel wise so we are going to go on a trip next summer instead. We are thinking of going to Hawaii! I'm very excited I think that if I can save about $200-300 per month during Fall and Winter semester than we should have enough money saved up by the summer to go! I'm not exactly sure how much it will cost, but I'm guessing it's going to be like $2000 total flying for us and another $1500 for hotels and maybe an extra $500 for food and stuff So probably like 4 - 5 k for the whole trip But that would also be going big Like nice hotels and stuff I think that I might be able to find an all inclusive deal that would be a lot less Okay, I'm going to bed now It's very late goodnight talk to you tomorrow!",

        "body": "Hello! How would you answer the question \"What is your secret superpower? (what are you really really good at?\" well for me I would answer with saying my ability to learn, I can watch someone do something and generally do it myslef. I have always been that way So I have a quick learning curve, and it comes in handy with dance and school Hello? I guess I can tell you about my week or day It was a good week, In english we have been working on our final project, its a documentary My group had some issues upfront But now we are back on track We did an interview of someone whose house burnt down, and talked to them about the value of possession So far it is turning out really nicely We have nice transitions and other videos to put the audio over In dance, I am in social and latin 100 levels And we finished up our finals this week. It was sad that I wont see them again. They were both fun classes We finished up with triple swing in social dance, and samba and salsa in latin dance American heritage is coming to close and it is crunch time Im hoping to keep a solid A- That class can be difficult Oh and programming I finished my final lab this week, It felt so good to be done with that I thought I did well but it didnt turn out as well as I hoped Which is fine, that final will probably be the most difficult I have struggled so much with that class, and I thought it was funny that they emailed me and asked me to apply to be a TA It made me laugh Religion class is fantastic with Bro Wilcox Im sad that one will be over too, I learn so much So, just keep taking. Are you sure you don't need more? Does your burn sting much? Do you eat popcorn much, or...? Do you want too? Dude, you have a very talented girlfriend. You're a failure for not catching that in your mouth. Are you making fancy feast? No, I'm making no bake cookies. My companion is just a very \"crumb-y\" person! Can you get an egg out of the fridge? Man I love you. Can we sit now? We've been walking for four hours! Basically i've just been typing what you guys have been saying. Oh, thanks so much man! So, what's the competition for? They're trying to make smarter AI units. And if BYU wins than they get funding for their CIS program. And I get a new computer! Hey can you hand me that? No! Not THAT. Hand me the whisk! How many people know you're actually over at our house? Are you sure you're comfortable? I do have a very boney back. Mitchell! He wasn't talking to you! Sorry. Hey do you want an earbud? Sure! Thanks. So, how long have you been dating? Oh, you know, a few months now. So, how did becca find out? FInd out what? About the comment I made? Oh, I told her. So, how did she respond? She said, \"We're cousins and you didn't even tell me!?\" Well I'm telling you now!!! Did you know you can have a full conversation just by saying \"Peanut Butter\"? You know I really want to get an Afro movie. A what? An \"outdoor movie\"... autocorrect. Isn't that just talking with your inflections? You can get your own chocolate chips. I'm stealing this. You can't steal it if it's given to you. But you didn't give this to me. True... See, home teaching, you go teach but what do you do with ministering? So, how's the new computer? It's not mine. Then who's is it? Mitchell's. Oh, i thought becuase you got the other one yesterday, that... It's ok. I'm just on mitchell's to help him win this competition thing. Got ya. Are you two wearing headphones? On this ear. Got ya, So you're sharing then? Yea. Bae! Go get your jam! You're jam would taste so good on it! Oh your right!!! Hey, anyone want some blue cheese? I'll take some! You know what? You should go take some to the bluebird broadcasting station! That would be funny! It smells so bad!!! Hey, but you can't smell when it turns bad! Can I have some butterscotch chips for my entree? I don't know, You didn't want them last night did you! Well, that's because it was late and I was trying to go to sleep!!! Whatever!!! So is that a yes?!?!? Sure!!!! Yea i totally got this at the swap meet yesterday. Turns out it's some type of styling gel. i don't know what to do with it now... Wait! So they made a parody of a parody of a parody? What? Yea, I'm sort of confused too. Do you have any syrup left? I have a little and I want to get rid of it. Does anyone have a gallon bag? I'm need it to make muddy buddies. I had one but it got a few holes in it so I threw it away. So, spencer has a laptop that he dropped and the monitor broke off.  So, he's planning on removing the display and giving me the bottom portion and using it as a home computer Sounds great, but how will you see if he takes the moniter off? Well, this is disappointing. My cookie dough ice cream has no cookie dough. It's just vanilla ice cream with sad chocolate flakes. What do you think you're doing!!! Commence repeating the word \"what\" in various ways. Looks like Caleb just made a fresh batch of bad beans. Funnily enough, while i'm trying to keep up with this conversation, I'm still eating chocolate to deal with my insatiable hunger. Also, I'm really skinny so i need all the cal calories that I can get. But hey, i guess this is just my lot in life. To continually eat while others continue to push the boundries of reality around me. It costs money? Which is more valuable? Time or money?",

Although, when you combine them you get the best of both worlds Thats why I think programs today are so awesome! They are beginning to implement more design into them. I can remember the time when designers drew on paper, and programmers wrote code, and to be honest, the programs were a disaster. At least in the elegance and refinement part of them. Even in big name companies like Microsoft, you can see a total difference between what they used to do in the early 2000s compared to now. Windows 10 is way more elegant than windows 98",
